## Uber's Privacy Principles

When you use Uber’s services, you trust us with your personal data. We’re
committed to keeping that trust, and that starts with helping you understand
our privacy practices. Our Privacy Principles set the foundation for how we
approach privacy at Uber.

![We do the right thing](https://www.uber-
assets.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,h_552,w_552/v1631549823/assets/47/ab929c-f63e-4cf2-ba1a-125d309618aa/original/We-
do-the-right-thing-with-data.png)

### We do the right thing with data.

Responsible data management is a prerequisite for continuous innovation. We
maintain the value of personal data for Uber and our users by handling data as
users expect, keeping it accurate and complete, and properly destroying it
when it is no longer needed. This improves our products, earns and keeps our
users’ trust, and differentiates us in the market.

![Build privacy](https://www.uber-
assets.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,h_552,w_552/v1631640001/assets/49/89bd9f-59b6-4bbf-91b4-43ac6815b253/original/Build-
privacy-into-our-products.png)

### We build privacy into our products from start to finish.

Privacy is an important component for building world-class products and
services, from inception to rollout and beyond. Performing privacy reviews on
new and changed products, technologies, and services makes sure they fulfill
users’ expectations and forms the bedrock of an exceptional customer
experience. This is called “privacy-by-design.”

![Collect only what we need](https://www.uber-
assets.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,h_552,w_552/v1631640151/assets/eb/54c102-d149-47b0-8e2a-1cf3b4e57d7c/original/Collect-
only-what-we-need.png)

### We collect only what we need.

We have a specific objective in mind when collecting, using, or handling
personal data that is consistent with our objectives and values. We collect
and use only the amount of personal data we need for approved and lawful
purposes.

![Transparent about data practices](https://www.uber-
assets.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,h_552,w_552/v1631640182/assets/c1/124157-c7fc-4128-9901-1f620727a565/original/Transparent-
about-our-data-practice.png)

### We are transparent about our data practices.

We are forthright about the personal data we collect and how we’re using and
sharing it. We do what we say.

![Give choices](https://www.uber-
assets.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,h_552,w_552/v1631640205/assets/0b/c8d175-263a-4c85-9fc8-13e6a1899f2e/original/Give-
users-choices.png)

### We give users choices about their data.

We give users clear choices about their privacy and controls that are easy to
use so that they can manage their data.

![Safeguard personal data](https://www.uber-
assets.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,h_552,w_552/v1631640233/assets/e4/39e1d8-9408-4d4e-940e-09ce7598f873/original/Safetguard-
personal-data.png)

### We safeguard personal data.

We provide reasonable and appropriate safeguards to prevent loss, and
unauthorized use or disclosure, of personal data.

## How we use your information

Uber puts transportation, food delivery, and other services at your
fingertips. Understanding what data we collect and how we use it should be
just as easy.

Our [Privacy Notice](https://www.uber.com/us/en/privacy-notice-riders-order-
recipients/) explains in detail what data we collect and how we use it to
provide you with a safe and reliable user experience.

We've summarized this information in the charts below for each category of
Uber users, specifically Riders and Order Recipients, and Drivers and Delivery
Persons.

These charts also indicate the legal basis that Uber relies on for each use of
data under privacy laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection
Regulation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

  * ### How does Uber use my location information?

We use it to enable our users to request, receive or provide rides or
deliveries; track and share trip or ride status; enhance our users’ safety and
security; for research and development; and for other purposes described in
our [Privacy Notice](https://www.uber.com/us/en/privacy-notice-riders-order-
recipients/).

  * ### Does Uber share my information with anyone?

Uber shares your data with others as necessary to enable the services you
request or provide through Uber. For example, if you request a ride, we share
your first name, rating, requested pick-up and drop-off locations with your
driver. We also share your information when you use features that involve data
sharing, such as when you share your trip or order status with friends or
family. We may also share your information with Uber affiliates, subsidiaries,
service providers, and business partners, or for legal reasons or in the event
of a dispute.

See our [Privacy Notice](https://www.uber.com/us/en/privacy-notice-riders-
order-recipients/) for more details.

  * ### How long does Uber keep my information?

Uber retains your data for as long as necessary for the purposes in our
[Privacy Notice](https://www.uber.com/us/en/privacy-notice-riders-order-
recipients/), which varies depending on data type, the category of user to
whom the data relates (e.g., riders versus drivers), the purposes for which we
collected the data, and whether the data must be retained after an account
deletion request for the purpose described in our [Privacy
Notice](https://www.uber.com/us/en/privacy-notice-riders-order-recipients/).

For example, we retain some data (such as account data) for the life of your
Uber account if necessary to provide our services. Other data we retain for
defined periods as necessary to meet tax, insurance, legal or regulatory
requirements (for example, we retain trip or order information for 7 years).

  * ### What happens to my information if I delete my account?

Following an account deletion request, we delete your account and data, except
as necessary for purposes of safety, security, fraud prevention or compliance
with legal requirements, or because of issues relating to your account (such
as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute). Such deletion
happens within 90 days of a deletion request for riders and order recipients,
and 7 years of a deletion request for drivers and delivery persons, except
where retention is necessary for the above reasons.

  * ### How do I request a copy of my data?

You can request a copy of your data
[here](https://accounts.uber.com/privacy/downloadyourdata) (login required).
Please see
[here](https://help.uber.com/h/3d476006-87a4-4404-ac1e-216825414e05?uclick_id=32ea8bbb-6c5f-41a2-a564-78176bb0fd7a)
for more information.

  * ### How do I submit a question to Uber’s Data Protection Officer (DPO)?

Uber’s DPO is responsible for guiding our compliance with data protection
regulation in the EU. They’re the point of contact for European privacy
regulators and questions and concerns from our users about data privacy. You
may submit questions to our DPO
[here](https://help.uber.com/h/489292a2-27ce-42f5-9a47-d4dd017559fd?uclick_id=32ea8bbb-6c5f-41a2-a564-78176bb0fd7a).
