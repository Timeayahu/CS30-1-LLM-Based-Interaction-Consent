This product-specific information is accompanied by our Data & Privacy\\nIcon.\\n\\n![Privacy Icon](https://www.apple.com/legal/images/icon_dataprivacy_2x.png)\\n\\nYou will be given an opportunity to review this product-specific information\\nbefore using these features. You also can view this information at any time,\\neither in settings related to those features and/or online at\\n[apple.com/legal/privacy/data](https://apple.com/legal/privacy/data).\\n\\nYou can familiarize yourself with our privacy practices, accessible via the\\nheadings below, and [contact us](contact/) if you have any questions.\\n\\n[Download a copy of this Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy/pdfs/apple-privacy-\\npolicy-en-ww.pdf)  \\n  \\n[Your California Privacy\\nDisclosures](https://apple.com/legal/privacy/california/)  \\n[Information Regarding Commercial Electronic Messages in\\nCanada](https://apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/canada-notice/)  \\n[Consumer Health Personal Data Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy/consumer-health-\\npersonal-data/en-ww/)  \\n[Apple Health Study Apps Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy/apple-health-\\nstudies/en-ww)\\n\\n  * ## What Is Personal Data at Apple?\\n\\nAt Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights ‚Äî and that those\\nfundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world.\\n**That‚Äôs why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable\\nindividual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as ‚Äúpersonal data,‚Äù\\nno matter where the individual lives.** This means that data that directly\\nidentifies you ‚Äî such as your name ‚Äî is personal data, and also data that does\\nnot directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you ‚Äî\\nsuch as the serial number of your device ‚Äî is personal data. Aggregated data\\nis considered non‚Äëpersonal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\\n\\nThis Privacy Policy covers how [Apple or an Apple-affiliated\\ncompany](affiliated-company/) (collectively, ‚ÄúApple‚Äù) handles personal data\\nwhether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as\\nApple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting an\\nApple Store). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make\\nthird-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple‚Äôs Privacy\\nPolicy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they\\nuse it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy\\nrights before interacting with them.\\n\\n  * ## Your Privacy Rights at Apple\\n\\nAt Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict\\nthe processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these\\nrights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy\\nrights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to\\nreceive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to\\nconsent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right\\nto withdraw your consent at any time.\\n\\n**To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party\\nservice provider is acting on Apple‚Äôs behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy\\npage at**[privacy.apple.com](https://privacy.apple.com)**for Apple\\nor**[shazam.com/privacy](https://shazam.com/privacy)**for Shazam.** To help\\nprotect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account\\nand your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal\\ndata that is not currently available from\\n[privacy.apple.com](http://privacy.apple.com), you can make a request at\\n[apple.com/legal/privacy/contact](/legal/privacy/contact/). You also have the\\nright to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator.\\n\\nThere may be situations where we cannot grant your request ‚Äî for example, if\\nyou ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to\\nkeep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to\\ngrant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for\\nanti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an\\naccount that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your\\nprivacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is\\nfrivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable.\\n\\n_If you live in California and you cannot access Apple‚Äôs Data and Privacy\\npage,_ you or your authorized agent can make a request at\\n[apple.com/legal/privacy/contact](/legal/privacy/contact/) or by calling\\n1-800-275-2273.\\n\\nFor more information on exercising your rights, visit\\n[support.apple.com/102283](https://support.apple.com/102283).\\n\\n  * ## Personal Data Apple Collects from You\\n\\nAt Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy. This\\nmeans that we strive to **collect only the personal data that we need**.

We have measures in place to reduce the\\namount of personal data we collect and make no attempt to connect data crawled\\nto any individual Apple user, or to build profiles about individuals. Your\\nprivate personal data is not used to train our foundational AI models.

We may also use personal data for other purposes with your\\nconsent.**\\n\\n**Apple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do\\nso.** Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the\\nfact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect\\nyour vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law.

More information is available in the product-specific\\ninformation embedded in our products and features as described above. If you\\nhave questions about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection\\nOfficer at [apple.com/legal/privacy/contact](/legal/privacy/contact/).\\n\\n    * **Power Our Services.** Apple collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting. For example, if you would like to access a song through an Apple Music subscription, we collect data on what songs you play in order to provide you with the content requested and for royalty purposes.\\n\\n    * **Process Your Transactions.** To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information.\\n\\n    * **Communicate with You.** To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback.

You can learn more about how relevant services use information to personalize your experience by reviewing the privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to use your personal data. We make this information easy to find by presenting it with our Data & Privacy icon; it‚Äôs also available at all times on your Apple device and online at [apple.com/legal/privacy/data](http://apple.com/legal/privacy/data). \\n\\n    * **Comply with Law.** To comply with applicable law ‚Äî for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request.\\n\\nApple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would\\nsignificantly affect you without the opportunity for human review. Apple also\\ndoes not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would\\nrequire a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California\\nlaw.\\n\\n**Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the\\npurposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy\\nPolicy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We\\nwill retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the\\npurposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy\\nnotices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether\\nit is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is\\nrequired, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period\\npermissible under law.**\\n\\n  * ## Apple‚Äôs Sharing of Personal Data\\n\\nApple may share personal data with **Apple-affiliated companies** , **service\\nproviders** who act on our behalf, our **partners** , **developers, and\\npublishers** , or others **at your direction**. Further, Apple does not share\\npersonal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes.\\n\\n    * **Service Providers.** Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and delivering products to customers. Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once they‚Äôve fulfilled our request.\\n\\n    * **Partners.** At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners. Apple requires its partners to protect your personal data.\\n\\n    * **Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription.** If you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.\\n\\n    * **Others.** Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.\\n\\nApple does not sell your personal data including as ‚Äúsale‚Äù is defined in\\nNevada and California. Apple also does not ‚Äúshare‚Äù your personal data as that\\nterm is defined in California.\\n\\n  * ## Protection of Personal Data at Apple\\n\\nAt Apple, we believe that great privacy rests on great security. We use\\n**administrative, technical, and physical safeguards** to protect your\\npersonal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the\\nprocessing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on\\nthese safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. For more information,\\nvisit our [Apple Platform\\nSecurity](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web) guide.\\n\\n  * ## Children and Personal Data\\n\\nApple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of\\nchildren, which we consider to be an**individual under the age of 13 or the\\nequivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction**. That is why Apple\\nhas implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children‚Äôs\\npersonal data safe.\\n\\nTo access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account. A\\nchild Apple Account may be created by the **parent** or, in the case of a\\nManaged Apple Account, by the **child‚Äôs educational institution**.\\n\\n    * **Parents.** To create a child account, parents must review the [Family Privacy Disclosure for Children](parent-disclosure/), which describes how Apple handles children‚Äôs personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent. \\n\\n    * **Educational Institutions.** Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called ‚ÄúManaged Apple IDs.‚Äù These schools are required to agree to the [Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure](https://www.apple.com/legal/education/apple-school-manager/) which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.\\n\\nIf we learn that a child‚Äôs personal data was collected without appropriate\\nauthorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.\\n\\n**To exercise privacy rights for your child‚Äôs information, visit the Apple\\nData and Privacy page at**[privacy.apple.com](https://privacy.apple.com)**and\\nsign in to their account.**\\n\\n  * ## Cookies and Other Technologies\\n\\nApple‚Äôs websites, online services, interactive applications, and\\nadvertisements may use [‚Äúcookies‚Äù and other technologies](cookies/) such as\\nweb beacons. **These technologies help us to better understand user behavior\\nincluding for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of\\nour websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness\\nof advertisements and web searches.**\\n\\n    * **Communications Cookies.** These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple‚Äôs systems, including by helping us detect any errors.\\n\\n    * **Strictly Necessary Cookies.** These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested.

[here](/terms/previous).\\n\\nThanks for using Dropbox! Our mission is to create a more enlightened way of\\nworking, and help you and those you work with stay coordinated. We do so by\\nproviding an intuitive, unified platform and suite of apps and services that\\nkeep your content safe, accessible and in sync. These terms of service\\n(‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) cover your use and access to our services, client software and\\nwebsites (\"Services\"). If you reside outside of the United States of America,\\nCanada and Mexico (‚ÄúNorth America‚Äù) your agreement is with Dropbox\\nInternational Unlimited Company. If you reside in North America your agreement\\nis with Dropbox, Inc. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.dropbox.com/privacy)\\nexplains how we collect and use your information while our [Acceptable Use\\nPolicy](https://www.dropbox.com/acceptable_use) outlines your responsibilities\\nwhen using our Services. If you are a member of a paid multi-user team (or a\\ntrial of a paid multi-user team) where an admin has control of your account\\n(\"Dropbox Team\"), your team will also be bound to the [Dropbox Services\\nAgreement](https://www.dropbox.com/business_agreement) or another agreement\\nbetween Dropbox and your team, and you will continue to remain subject to\\nthese Terms. By using our Services, you‚Äôre agreeing to be bound by these\\nTerms, our [Privacy Policy](https://www.dropbox.com/privacy), and [Acceptable\\nUse Policy](https://www.dropbox.com/acceptable_use).\\n\\nYour stuff & your permissions\\n\\nWhen you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files,\\ncontent, messages, contacts, connected services and so on (‚ÄúYour Stuff‚Äù). Your\\nStuff is yours. These Terms don‚Äôt give us any rights to Your Stuff except for\\nthe limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.\\n\\nYou may need to register for an account to access the Services, and we may\\ncreate an account for you so that you can interact with the Services.\\n\\nOur Services include a suite of apps and websites. To help you stay\\nproductive, when you use the same account to access different parts of the\\nsuite, Your Stuff may come with you.\\n\\nWe need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up\\nand sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features\\nsuch as commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews,\\noptical character recognition (OCR), easy sorting and organisation, and\\npersonalisation, to help reduce busywork. To provide these and other features,\\nDropbox accesses, stores and scans Your Stuff. You give us permission to do\\nthose things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third\\nparties we work with.\\n\\nYour Responsibilities\\n\\nYour use of our Services must comply with our [Acceptable Use\\nPolicy](https://www.dropbox.com/acceptable_use). Content in the Services may\\nbe protected by others‚Äô intellectual property rights. Please don‚Äôt copy,\\nupload, download or share content unless you have the right to do so.\\n\\nDropbox may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms\\nand our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.dropbox.com/acceptable_use).

Finally, to use our Services, you must be at\\nleast 13 if you reside in the United States, and 16 if you reside anywhere\\nelse. If the law where you reside requires that you must be older in order for\\nDropbox to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent\\n(including use of your personal data), then you must be that older age.\\n\\nSoftware\\n\\nSome of our Services allow you to download client software (‚ÄòSoftware‚Äô), which\\nmay be updated automatically. As long as you comply with these Terms, we give\\nyou a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the\\nSoftware, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the\\nSoftware may be offered under an open source licence, we‚Äôll make that licence\\navailable to you, and the provisions of that licence may expressly override\\nsome of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law,\\nyou agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so\\nor assist anyone to do so.\\n\\nBeta Services\\n\\nWe sometimes release products and features that we‚Äôre still testing and\\nevaluating (‚ÄòBeta Services‚Äô). Beta Services are labelled ‚Äòalpha‚Äô, ‚Äòbeta‚Äô,\\n‚Äòpreview‚Äô, ‚Äòearly access‚Äô or ‚Äòevaluation‚Äô (or with words or phrases with\\nsimilar meanings) and may not be as reliable as Dropbox‚Äôs other services. Beta\\nServices are made available so that we can collect user feedback and, by using\\nour Beta Services, you agree that we may contact you to collect such feedback.\\n\\nBeta Services are confidential until they are officially launched. If you use\\nany Beta Services, you agree not to disclose any information about those\\nServices to anyone else without our permission.\\n\\nElectronic Signatures\\n\\nBy using a part of the Services that facilitates electronic signatures, you\\nagree to do business electronically and to use electronic records and\\nsignatures. There may be laws where you reside governing what types of\\ndocuments and transactions are appropriate for such signatures. It‚Äôs your\\nresponsibility to ensure that the electronic signature functionality provided\\nby the Services is appropriate for your scenario.\\n\\nTemplates and Forms\\n\\nThe Services may include sample templates and forms (‚ÄúTemplates‚Äù). Templates\\nare for informational purposes only. We are not lawyers or a law firm, and our\\nTemplates are not a substitute for the advice or services of a lawyer. You\\nacknowledge that Dropbox is not providing you with legal advice or acting as\\nyour lawyer or agent, and you assume full responsibility for any outcomes or\\ncosts associated with your use of our Templates.  \\n\\nDropbox does not claim that documents based on the Templates are complete and\\nsuitable for use in all situations and jurisdictions. You should consult with\\na lawyer about your specific situation before relying on the Templates for any\\ncontract, agreement or transaction. You hereby acknowledge that Dropbox is not\\na party to any agreement that you enter into as a result of the use of any\\ndocument that you create or use through the Services. Use of the Services and\\nany document (including any document based on the Templates) does not\\nconstitute a lawyer-client relationship, joint venture or partnership between\\nDropbox and any user or third party. Communications between you and Dropbox\\nare governed by these Terms and our [Privacy\\nPolicy](https://www.dropbox.com/privacy) but are not protected by the lawyer-\\nclient privilege or as work product.\\n\\nWe hope you‚Äôre satisfied with the Templates. If you have any concerns, please\\nclick [here](https://help.dropbox.com/account-settings/customer-support-\\nlevels) for more information and instructions on how to contact us.\\n\\nThe disclaimers of warranties and limitations of liability below do not apply\\nto consumers in North Carolina when using the Templates.  \\n\\nFax Services  \\n\\nIf you use a part of the Services that facilitates faxing, you may be required\\nto provide information such as your name, billing address, physical address,\\npayment information (including credit card number) and national ID number\\n(where applicable).

If you stop using our fax services, your number may be released or\\nreassigned to another customer. In the US, UK and Canada, we may support\\nporting a fax number (both in and out) for an additional fee.\\n\\nAdditional Features\\n\\nFrom time to time, Dropbox will add additional features to enhance the user\\nexperience of our storage service at no additional charge. However, these free\\nfeatures may be withdrawn without further notice.\\n\\nThird-Party features\\n\\nThe Services may give you the option to link to third-party features and\\nintegrations. Dropbox does not own or operate any such features or\\nintegrations. If you access or use any third-party features or integrations,\\nyou are responsible for this access and use, and Dropbox is not responsible\\nfor any act or omission of the third party or the availability, accuracy, the\\nrelated content, products or services of third parties.\\n\\nOur stuff\\n\\nThe Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign\\nlaws. These Terms don‚Äôt grant you any right, title or interest in the\\nServices, others‚Äô content in the Services, Dropbox trademarks, logos and other\\nbrand features. We welcome feedback, but please note that we may use comments\\nor suggestions without any obligation to you.\\n\\nCopyright\\n\\nWe respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We\\nrespond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the\\nlaw, and such notices should be reported using our [Copyright\\nPolicy](https://www.dropbox.com/dmca). We reserve the right to delete or\\ndisable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat\\ninfringers. Copyright infringement claims should be submitted using our\\n[Copyright Complaint Form](https://www.dropbox.com/copyright_complaint) or\\nsubmitted to our designated agent for our Services at:\\n\\nCopyright Agent  \\nDropbox, Inc.  \\n1800 Owens St  \\nSan Francisco, CA 94158  \\nUSA  \\ncopyright@dropbox.com\\n\\nPaid Accounts\\n\\nBilling. You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your\\naccount (turning your account into a ‚ÄúPaid Account‚Äù). We‚Äôll automatically bill\\nyou from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal\\ndate until cancellation. If you‚Äôre on an annual plan, we‚Äôll send you a notice\\nemail reminding you that your plan is about to be renewed within a reasonable\\nperiod of time prior to the renewal date. You‚Äôre responsible for all\\napplicable taxes, and we‚Äôll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries\\nhave mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this\\nparagraph doesn‚Äôt override these laws.\\n\\nCancellation. You may cancel your [Paid\\nAccount](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/cancellations-\\nrefunds/downgrade-dropbox-plus-professional-plans) at any time. Refunds are\\nonly issued if [required by law](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-\\nbilling/payments-billing/refund). For example, users living in the European\\nUnion have the right to cancel their Paid Account subscriptions and obtain a\\nrefund within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to or renewing a Paid\\nAccount by clicking\\n[here](https://www.dropbox.com/support/email/billing_and_payments/submit).\\n\\nDowngrades. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it\\'s cancelled or\\nterminated under these Terms. If you‚Äôre on a Dropbox Family plan, the Family\\nmanager may be able to downgrade your account at any time. If you don‚Äôt pay\\nfor your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or remove\\nPaid Account features.\\n\\nChanges. We may change the fees in effect on renewal of your subscription to\\nreflect factors such as changes to our product offerings, changes to our\\nbusiness or changes in economic conditions. We‚Äôll give you no less than 30\\ndays‚Äô advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address\\nassociated with your account and you‚Äôll have the opportunity to cancel your\\nsubscription before the new fee comes into effect.\\n\\nDropbox Teams\\n\\nEmail address. If you sign up for a Dropbox account with an email address\\nprovisioned by your organisation, your organisation may be able to block your\\nuse of Dropbox until you transition to an account on a Dropbox Team or you\\nassociate your Dropbox account with a personal email address.\\n\\nUsing Dropbox Teams. If you join a Dropbox Team, you must use it in compliance\\nwith your organisation‚Äôs terms and policies. Please note that Dropbox Team\\naccounts are subject to your organisation‚Äôs control. Your administrators may\\nbe able to access, disclose, restrict or remove information in or from your\\nDropbox Team account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your\\naccess to a Dropbox Team account. If you convert an existing Dropbox account\\ninto part of a Dropbox Team, your administrators may prevent you from later\\ndisassociating your account from the Dropbox Team.\\n\\nTermination\\n\\nYou‚Äôre free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to\\nsuspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if Dropbox\\nreasonably believes:\\n\\n  1. you‚Äôre in breach of these Terms,\\n  2. your use of the Services would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or\\n  3. you don‚Äôt have a Paid Account and haven\\'t accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.\\n\\nWe‚Äôll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address\\nassociated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to\\ncontact you, and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our\\nServices. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we‚Äôll\\nterminate or suspend your access to the Services.\\n\\nWe won‚Äôt provide notice or an opportunity to export Your Stuff before\\ntermination or suspension of access to the Services where Dropbox reasonably\\nbelieves:\\n\\n  1. you‚Äôre in material breach of these Terms, which includes, but is not limited to, violating our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.dropbox.com/acceptable_use),\\n  2. doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or\\n  3. we‚Äôre prohibited from doing so by law.\\n\\nOnce we suspend or terminate your access to the Services, you will not be able\\nto access or export Your Stuff. Dropbox does not provide refunds if we suspend\\nor terminate your access to the Services, unless required by law.\\n\\nDiscontinuation of Services\\n\\nWe may decide to discontinue the Services in response to exceptional\\nunforeseen circumstances, events beyond Dropbox‚Äôs control (for example a\\nnatural disaster, fire or explosion) or to comply with a legal requirement. If\\nwe do so, we‚Äôll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your\\nStuff from our systems (we will give you no less than 30 days‚Äô notice where\\npossible under the circumstances). If we discontinue the Services in this way\\nbefore the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we‚Äôll refund\\nthe portion of the fees you have prepaid but haven\\'t received Services for.\\n\\nServices ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù\\n\\nWe strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we\\ncan‚Äôt guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS\\nAFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù. WE ALSO\\nDISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\\nAND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don‚Äôt allow the disclaimers in this\\nparagraph, so they may not apply to you. For example, these disclaimers do not\\noverride the legal protections, including statutory warranties, granted to\\nconsumers by EU law.\\n\\nLimitation of Liability\\n\\nWE DON‚ÄôT EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO\\nSO ‚Äì THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX‚ÄôS OR ITS AFFILIATES‚Äô FRAUD OR\\nFRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE\\nFOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSION AREN‚ÄôT ALLOWED, WE‚ÄôRE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR\\nLOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO\\nUSE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS\\nPARAGRAPH DOESN‚ÄôT AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN‚ÄôT BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY\\nANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE AN EU OR UK CONSUMER, THESE TERMS DO NOT\\nEXCLUDE DROPBOX‚ÄôS LIABILITY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A RESULT OF OUR\\nFAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES OR OF OUR\\nBREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU, AS LONG AS THOSE LOSSES AND DAMAGES ARE\\nREASONABLY FORESEEABLE.\\n\\nIN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED,\\nDROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON‚ÄôT BE LIABLE FOR:\\n\\n  1. ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR\\n  2. ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.\\n\\nTHESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT\\nDROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\\nDAMAGES.\\n\\nIF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS OR RE-SALE PURPOSE,\\nDROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO\\nYOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF\\nBUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN‚ÄôT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE\\nCONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USERS OF THE SERVICES.\\n\\nOTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN\\nTHIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100%\\nOF ANY AMOUNT YOU\\'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX. THIS\\nPROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO EU CONSUMERS WHERE PROHIBITED BY [APPLICABLE\\nLAW](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/terms-service-\\nlimitation-liability).\\n\\nResolving Disputes\\n\\nLet‚Äôs try to sort things out first. We want to address your concerns without\\nneeding a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree\\nto try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us a written Notice of\\nDispute at dispute-notice@dropbox.com that includes your name, a detailed\\ndescription of the dispute and the relief you seek. We‚Äôll try to resolve the\\ndispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved\\nwithin 60 days after submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.\\nIf you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides for an online\\ndispute resolution platform, which you can access here:\\n<https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr>.\\n\\nJudicial Forum for Disputes. You and Dropbox agree that any judicial\\nproceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be\\nbrought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California,\\nsubject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Dropbox\\nconsent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a\\ncountry (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that\\ngive consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this\\nparagraph doesn‚Äôt affect those requirements. The venue and exclusive\\njurisdiction provision above does not apply to North Carolina consumers with\\nrespect to claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates.\\n\\nIF YOU‚ÄôRE A US RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION\\nPROVISIONS:\\n\\nWe both agree to arbitrate. You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims\\nrelating to or arising out of these Terms or the Services through final and\\nbinding individual arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth\\nunder the ‚ÄòExceptions to agreement to arbitrate‚Äô below. This includes disputes\\narising out of or relating to the interpretation or application of this\\n‚ÄòMandatory Arbitration Provisions‚Äô section, including its scope,\\nenforceability, revocability or validity. The arbitrator may award relief only\\nindividually and only to the extent necessary to redress your individual\\nclaim(s); the arbitrator may not award relief on behalf of others or the\\ngeneral public.\\n\\nOpt out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate\\nby [clicking here](https://www.dropbox.com/arbitration_optout) and submitting\\nthe opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account or agreeing\\nto these Terms. However, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms\\nthat allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or\\nnot opt out remains binding.\\n\\nArbitration Procedures. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will\\nadminister the arbitration under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA‚Äôs\\nrules and filing instructions are available at\\n[www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The\\narbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work,\\nSan Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to. For North Carolina\\nconsumers, for claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates, the\\narbitration will be held in North Carolina or any other location we agree to.\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Incentives. The AAA rules will govern payment of all\\narbitration fees. For individual arbitration of non-frivolous claims less than\\n75,000 USD for which you provided Dropbox with a Notice of Dispute, Dropbox\\nwill reimburse arbitration filing fees at the conclusion of the arbitration\\nand will pay other arbitration fees. For all other claims, the costs and fees\\nof arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration\\nprovider‚Äôs rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims. If\\nyou receive an arbitration award that is more favourable than any offer we\\nmake to resolve the claim, we will pay you 1,000 USD in addition to the award.\\nDropbox will not seek its attorneys\\' fees and costs in arbitration unless the\\narbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper\\npurpose.\\n\\nExceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or Dropbox may assert claims,\\nif they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United\\nStates county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely\\nfor injunctive relief to stop unauthorised use or abuse of the Services, or\\nintellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret,\\ncopyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the\\ninformal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to\\narbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the\\nexclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco\\nCounty, California to resolve your claim. This exclusive jurisdiction\\nprovision does not apply to North Carolina consumers with respect to claims\\nrelating to or arising out of use of the Templates.\\n\\nNO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS. You may only resolve disputes with us on\\nan individual basis and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member\\nin a class, consolidated or representative action. Class arbitrations, class\\nactions, private lawyer general actions and consolidation with other\\narbitrations aren‚Äôt allowed.\\n\\nSeverability. If any part of this ‚ÄòMandatory Arbitration Provisions‚Äô section\\nis found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect,\\nexcept that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow\\nclass or representative arbitration, this ‚ÄòMandatory Arbitration Provisions‚Äô\\nsection will be unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-\\nwaivable right to bring a particular claim or to request a particular form of\\nrelief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award according to\\nthis ‚ÄòMandatory Arbitration Provisions‚Äô section, including public injunctive\\nrelief, then only that respective claim or request for relief may be brought\\nin court, and you and we agree that litigation of any such claim or request\\nfor relief shall be stayed pending the resolution of any individual claim(s)\\nor request(s) for relief in arbitration.\\n\\nControlling Law\\n\\nThese Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of\\nlaws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European\\nUnion) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of\\nthe consumer\\'s country. This paragraph doesn‚Äôt override those laws.\\n\\nEntire Agreement\\n\\nThese Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with\\nrespect to the subject matter of these Terms and supersede and replace any\\nother prior or contemporaneous agreements or terms and conditions applicable\\nto the subject matter of these Terms. Our past, present and future affiliates\\nand agents can invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become\\ninvolved in a dispute with you.

For example, [Security\\nCheckup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?utm_source=pp&hl=en_US)\\nprovides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending\\non your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you‚Äôve\\nalready installed and videos you‚Äôve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you\\nmight like.\\n\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you [personalized\\nads](privacy?hl=en-US#footnote-personalized-ads) based on your interests and\\nactivity across Google services.

And we also use data about the ads you interact\\nwith, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers\\nunderstand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to\\ndo this, including Google Analytics.

We also use [algorithms](privacy?hl=en-US#footnote-algorithm)\\nto recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people\\ncommunicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases\\nyou ask it to translate.\\n\\nWe may [use the information we collect](privacy?hl=en-US#footnote-combine-\\ninfo) across our services and across your devices for the purposes described\\nabove. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos\\nof guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site\\nthat uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, [your activity\\non other sites and apps](privacy?hl=en-US#footnote-other-sites) may be\\nassociated with your personal information in order to improve Google‚Äôs\\nservices and the ads delivered by Google.\\n\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that\\nidentifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account\\ninformation, such as your name and photo.

For\\nexample, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all\\nconsidered devices.\\n\\n### Google Account\\n\\nYou may access some of our services by signing up for a [Google\\nAccount](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US) and providing us with some\\npersonal information (typically your name, email address, and a password).\\nThis account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google\\nservices and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can\\nedit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.\\n\\n### IP address\\n\\nEvery device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an\\nInternet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in\\ngeographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location\\nfrom which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about [how we\\nuse location information.](technologies/location-data?hl=en-US)\\n\\n### Non-personally identifiable information\\n\\nThis is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects\\nor references an individually-identifiable user.\\n\\n### Personal information\\n\\nThis is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you,\\nsuch as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that\\ncan be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we\\nassociate with your Google Account.\\n\\n### Pixel tag\\n\\nA pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of\\nan email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a\\nwebsite or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination\\nwith cookies.\\n\\n### Referrer URL\\n\\nA Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a\\ndestination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that\\npage. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser\\nvisited.\\n\\n### Sensitive personal information\\n\\nThis is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such\\nas confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or\\nreligious beliefs, or sexuality.\\n\\n### Server logs\\n\\nLike most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made\\nwhen you visit our sites. These ‚Äúserver logs‚Äù typically include your web\\nrequest, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date\\nand time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify\\nyour browser.\\n\\nA typical log entry for a search for ‚Äúcars‚Äù looks like this:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -  \\n    http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -  \\n    Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -  \\n    740674ce2123e969\\n\\n  * `123.45.67.89` is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user‚Äôs ISP. Depending on the user‚Äôs service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.\\n  * `25/Mar/2003 10:15:32` is the date and time of the query.\\n  * `http://www.google.com/search?q=cars` is the requested URL, including the search query.\\n  * `Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7` is the browser and operating system being used.\\n  * `740674ce2123a969` is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they‚Äôve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).\\n\\n### Unique identifiers\\n\\nA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely\\nidentify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how\\npermanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be\\naccessed.\\n\\nUnique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and\\nfraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your\\npreferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique\\nidentifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in\\nyour preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies\\nor to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about [how Google uses\\ncookies](technologies/cookies?hl=en-US).\\n\\nOn other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize\\na specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such\\nas the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android\\ndevices, and can be [managed](technologies/ads?hl=en-US) in your device‚Äôs\\nsettings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its\\nmanufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the\\nIMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device‚Äôs unique identifier can\\nbe used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues\\nrelated to our services.\\n\\n## Additional Context\\n\\n### Activity on Google Services\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned\\non, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in\\nyour account‚Äôs Web & App Activity.

When you search\\nfor something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3\\nsq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000\\npeople. This helps protect your privacy.\\n\\nIn some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to\\nestimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for\\ncoffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future\\nsearches.\\n\\nYou can view and control your Web & App Activity at [My\\nActivity](https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols?hl=en_US).\\n\\n### activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\n\\nWebsites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share\\ninformation with us.\\n\\nThis information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you\\nuse.

If we deny your request\\nto exercise your rights, you may have the right to appeal our decision by\\ncontacting us using [privacy-support@pinterest.com](mailto:privacy-\\nsupport@pinterest.com).\\n\\nYou have choices regarding your information on Pinterest. If you have a\\nPinterest account, many of these controls are built directly into Pinterest or\\nyour settings.

Depending on where you live, we\\nalso make this public information available through what are called APIs (a\\ntechnical way to share information quickly). For example, a partner can study\\nwhat their most popular Pins are or how their Pins are being shared on\\nPinterest by using a Pinterest API. We also share the categories of\\ninformation described above:\\n\\n  * With other services, at your direction. For example, when you decide to [link your Pinterest account](https://help.pinterest.com/article/link-your-social-media) to third party services, or when you publish your content on Pinterest to such services, you direct disclosure of certain information to those services. Creators may direct us to share information with advertisers or other partners for paid engagements.\\n  * Depending on where you live, we share data for advertising and related purposes, including showing you ads about Pinterest on third-party services, showing you ads through our partners, and helping advertisers understand how ads on Pinterest perform. For example, when you fill out a lead ad form, or click on an ad on Pinterest, we‚Äôll share this information with advertising partners.\\n  * With vendors that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam. Some information we acquire may be collected by vendors on our behalf.\\n  * With law enforcement agencies, government agencies, researchers, or other parties in compliance with laws, rules, or regulations. For example, we may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts. We only disclose information in response to such requests if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Pinterest; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. We may also share information if we believe it is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person in emergency situations. To find out more about how we respond to law enforcement requests, please see our [Law Enforcement Guidelines](https://help.pinterest.com/article/law-enforcement-guidelines). We may share your publicly accessible information with independent researchers who meet certain criteria, to combat societal harms.\\n  * With our corporate family of companies, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Privacy Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser).\\n\\n# Transferring your information\\n\\nPinterest is a worldwide service. By using our products or services, you\\nauthorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country,\\nincluding in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy. The\\nprivacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal\\ninformation in such countries may not be equivalent to those of your home\\ncountry.\\n\\nAdditional steps for data transfers in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK\\n\\nIf you live in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we take additional steps\\nrelated to data transfers. Information controlled by Pinterest Europe Limited\\nwill be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United\\nStates or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as\\ndescribed in this policy. Safeguards which we rely on in ensuring your\\ninformation benefits from an adequate level of protection includes the\\nfollowing:\\n\\nAdequacy decisions. These are decisions issued from the European Commission\\nunder Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they\\nrecognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We\\ntransfer your information as described in ‚ÄúHow we use the info we collect‚Äù to\\nsome countries with such adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed\\nhere; or\\n\\nStandard contractual clauses (‚ÄúSCCs‚Äù). The European Commission has approved\\ncontractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the\\nEEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for\\nthe UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on\\nstandard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in ‚ÄúHow we\\nuse the info we collect‚Äù to third parties in countries without an adequacy\\ndecision.\\n\\nWhile transfers to countries that don‚Äôt have an adequacy decision typically\\ntake place on the basis of SCCs, in certain circumstances, transfers can also\\ntake place on the basis of exemptions provided under data protection law. For\\nexample, sharing with law enforcement, in emergency situations where we learn\\nthat a person‚Äôs life is at risk.\\n\\nWe also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data\\ntransfer. For example, we use:\\n\\n  * technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation; and\\n  * policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests.\\n\\nFor a copy of these adequacy decisions or SCCs, please contact us via the\\ndetails provided in the Contact us section below.\\n\\n# How long we keep your information\\n\\nWe keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Pinterest to\\nyou and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. When we no longer need\\nto use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with\\nour legal or regulatory obligations, we‚Äôll either remove it from our systems\\nor depersonalize it so that we can't use it to identify you.\\n\\nIf you live in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, here is some further\\ninformation on our retention practices: We keep your information only so long\\nas necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, which include\\nproviding our Service, or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying\\nwith legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to\\nfight spam, or protecting or defending our rights, property and users. The\\nstorage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis. We keep account\\ninformation, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your\\naccount is in existence because we need it to operate your account.\\n\\n# Our policy on children's information\\n\\nChildren under 13 are not allowed to use Pinterest. If you are based in a\\nstate or country with an older age requirement, you may only use the Services\\nif you are at or over the age at which you can provide consent to data\\nprocessing. Please visit the [Help\\nCenter](https://help.pinterest.com/article/age-requirements-for-using-\\npinterest) for more information.\\n\\n# How we make changes to this policy\\n\\nWe may change this policy from time to time and if we do, we‚Äôll post any\\nchanges on this page. If you continue to use Pinterest after those changes are\\nin effect, the new policy applies to you. If the changes are significant, we\\nmay provide a more prominent notice, such as by sending you an email.\\n\\n# Contact us\\n\\nThe best way to get in touch with us or to exercise your options described\\nabove is through the [Help Center](https://help.pinterest.com/contact).

Last Revised: August 16, 2024.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nAt Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our users to\\nbe the masters of their identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you\\nunderstand how and why Reddit (‚ÄúReddit,‚Äú ‚Äúwe‚Äú or ‚Äúus‚Äù) collects, uses, and\\nshares information about you when you use our websites, mobile apps, widgets,\\nAPIs, emails, and other online products and services (collectively, the\\n‚ÄúServices‚Äú) or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication\\nfrom us.\\n\\nWe want this privacy policy to empower you to make better choices about how\\nyou use Reddit. We\\'d love for you to read the whole policy, but if you don\\'t,\\nhere is the TL;DR:\\n\\n  * [Reddit is a public platform.](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/26410290525844)\\n\\nReddit is a public platform. Our communities are largely public and anyone can\\nsee your profile, posts, and comments.\\n\\n  * We collect minimal information about you.\\n\\nWe collect minimal information that can be used to identify you by default. If\\nyou want to just browse, you don\\'t need an account. If you want to create an\\naccount to participate in a subreddit, we don\\'t require you to give us your\\nreal name. We don\\'t track your precise location. You can even browse\\n[anonymously](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/360045622611-What-is-\\nAnonymous-Browsing-and-how-does-it-work-). You can share as much or as little\\nabout yourself as you want when using Reddit.\\n\\n  * We only use data to make Reddit a better place.\\n\\nAny data we collect is used primarily to provide our Services, which are\\nfocused on allowing people to come together and form communities. We don\\'t\\nsell your personal data to third parties, and we never work with data brokers.\\n\\n  * All of our users get privacy rights - not just those in select countries.\\n\\nPrivacy rights are for everyone. At Reddit, anyone can request a copy of their\\ndata, account deletion, or information about our policies.\\n\\n  * If you have questions about how we use data, just ask.\\n\\nWe\\'ve tried our best to make this as easy to understand as possible but\\nsometimes privacy policies are still confusing. If you need help understanding\\nthis policy or anything about Reddit, [just\\nask](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001370251).\\n\\n## Reddit Is a Public Platform\\n\\nMuch of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone,\\neven without an account. By using the Services, you are directing us to share\\nthis information publicly and freely.\\n\\nWhen you submit content (e.g., a post, comment, or chat message) to a public\\npart of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able\\nto see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date\\nand time you originally submitted the content. That content and information\\nmay also be available in search results on Internet search engines like Google\\nor in responses provided by an AI chatbot like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. You should\\ntake the public nature of the Services into consideration before posting.\\n\\nYour Reddit account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains\\ninformation about your activities on the Services, such as your username,\\nprior posts and comments, karma, trophies received, profile display name,\\nabout section, and social links, avatar or profile image, moderator,\\ncontributor, and Reddit Premium status, communities you are active in, and how\\nlong you have been a member of the Services (your cake day).\\n\\nWe offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you\\ntake on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the\\nsharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on\\nthe settings you establish with the third party that provides the social\\nsharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data\\ncollection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please\\nvisit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social\\nsharing features (e.g., [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/privacy),\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/), and\\n[X](https://twitter.com/privacy)).\\n\\nReddit allows moderators to access Reddit content using moderator bots and\\ntools. Reddit also allows other third parties to access public Reddit content\\nusing Reddit‚Äôs developer services, including Reddit Embeds, our APIs,\\nDeveloper Platform, and similar technologies. We limit third-party access to\\nthis content and require third parties to pay licensing fees for access to\\nlarger quantities of content. Reddit‚Äôs [Developer\\nTerms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms) are our standard\\nterms governing how these services are used by third parties. Please review\\nour public content policy\\n[here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/26410290525844-Public-\\nContent-Policy) for more information about how your public content is publicly\\navailable and accessible to anyone with access to the internet.\\n\\n## What Information We Collect\\n\\n|  |    \\n_Information You Provide to Us_  \\nWe collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:  |   \\n---|---|---  \\n|  _Account information_ |  |  You don\\'t need an account to use Reddit. If you create a Reddit account, your account will have a username, which you provide or which is automatically generated. Your username is public, and it doesn\\'t have to be related to your real name. You may need to provide a password, depending on whether you register using an email address, Single Sign-On (SSO) feature (such as Apple or Google), or phone number. If your account does not have a password, we may send you a SMS message for verification purposes. We may also ask you to select interests during account creation (for example, history, nature, sports) to help generate a home feed for you, or to select communities (such as, r/technology) to join.  When you use Reddit, you may also provide other information, such as a bio, gender, age, location, profile picture, or social link. This information is optional and may be removed at any time.  We also store your user account preferences and settings. We may ask for such information prior to you creating a username or account to help improve your experience exploring Reddit.  |   \\n|  _Non-Public Content You Submit_ |  |  In addition to the public content you submit to the Services, we also collect non-public content. This includes your saved drafts of posts or comments, your messages with other users (such as private messages, chats, and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, audio, videos, software, and tools.  |   \\n|  _Actions you take_ |  |  We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with the platform and content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, and blocking. We collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.  |   \\n|  _Transactional information_ |  |  If you purchase products or services from us or otherwise through the Services, you will have to provide payment information in order to complete your purchase. Reddit uses industry-standard payment processor services (such as Stripe) to handle payment information, and those services are subject to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies. We will collect information about the product or service you are purchasing (for example, purchase dates, amounts paid or received, and expiration and renewal dates).  We may also collect public blockchain data and addresses, such as when you purchase or create a Collectible Avatar, receive or mint an NFT, or create a Reddit Vault. However, we never store Reddit Vault private key information.  |   \\n|  _Other information_ |  |  You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, survey, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities, promotions, or programs, apply for a job, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.  |   \\n  \\n|  |    \\n_Information We Collect Automatically_  \\nWhen you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:  |   \\n---|---|---  \\n|  _Log and usage data_ |  |  We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (such as device IDs), device settings, mobile carrier name, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.  |   \\n|  _Information collected from cookies and similar technologies_ |  |  We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to deliver and maintain our Services, improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, measure the effectiveness of advertising, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. See our [Cookie Notice](https://www.reddit.com/policies/cookies) for more information about how Reddit uses cookies. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see ‚ÄúYour Choices‚Äù below.  |   \\n|  _Location information_ |  |  We may receive and process information about your location. We may receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including via the Location Customization setting or by associating your content with a location, or we may derive an approximate location based on your IP address.  |   \\n  \\n|  |    \\n_Information Collected from Other Sources_  \\nWe may receive information about you from other sources, including from other\\nusers and third parties, and combine that information with the other\\ninformation we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or\\ninterest information about you from third parties, including advertisers (such\\nas the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and\\ncombine it with data you have provided to Reddit, using a common account\\nidentifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can\\ncontrol how we use this information to personalize advertisements for you by\\nvisiting the User Settings menu in your account, as described in the section\\ntitled ‚ÄúYour Rights and Choices‚Äù below.  \\n|  \\n---|---|---  \\n|  _Linked services_ |  |  If you authorize or link a third-party service, such as an unofficial mobile app client, to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service. For example, if you sign in to Reddit with a third-party identity provider, that provider may share an email address with us. To learn how information is shared with linked services, see ‚ÄúHow Information About You Is Shared‚Äù below.  |   \\n|  _Information collected from integrations_ |  |  We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate our Services, including our embeds and advertising technology. For example, when you visit a site that uses [Reddit embeds](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/embeds-terms), we may receive information about the web page you visited. Similarly, if an advertiser incorporates Reddit‚Äôs ad technology, Reddit may receive limited information about your activity on the advertiser‚Äôs site or app, such as whether you bought something from the advertiser. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you as described in ‚ÄúYour Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics‚Äù below.  |   \\n  \\n|  |   \\n_Information Collected by Third Parties_ |   \\n---|---|---  \\n|  _Embedded content_ |  |  Reddit displays some linked content in-line on the Services via embeds. For example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or X may load the linked video or tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don\\'t have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is embedded.  |   \\n|  _Audience measurement_ |  |  We partner with service providers that perform audience measurement to learn demographic information about the population that uses Reddit. To provide this demographic information, these companies collect cookie information to recognize your device.  |   \\n  \\n|  |    \\n_Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers_  \\nInformation Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers If you use\\nReddit Ads (Reddit‚Äôs self-serve ads platform at ads.reddit.com), on behalf of\\nyour business or organization, we collect some additional information. To sign\\nup for Reddit Ads, you must provide your name, email address, and information\\nabout your company. Reddit may make information about your company public to\\ncomply with applicable law. If you purchase advertising services, you will\\nneed to provide transactional information as described above, and we may also\\nrequire additional documentation to verify your identity. When using Reddit\\nAds, we may record a session replay of your visit for customer service,\\ntroubleshooting, and usability research purposes.  \\n  \\n|  \\n---|---|---  \\n|  \\n_Information Collected from Reddit Pro Users_  \\nIf you sign up for Reddit Pro, on behalf of yourself, your business or\\norganization, we may collect some additional information from you, including\\nyour profile type, name, industry category, website, and organization size, if\\napplicable. If you request certain limited Reddit Pro features, we may request\\nadditional documentation to verify your identity.  \\n  \\n|  \\n  \\n|  |    \\n_Information Collected from Reddit Program Participants and Potential\\nParticipants_  \\nIf you sign up to participate in a Reddit Program (for example, our\\nContributor Program), we collect, directly or indirectly through our\\nproviders, some additional information from you (such as your name, date of\\nbirth, address, email, tax, government ID, and payment information). This\\nadditional information is used and shared with our third-party payment and\\ncompliance providers to determine your eligibility to participate in the\\napplicable Reddit Program, facilitate payments, and comply with law. Those\\nproviders and their services are subject to separate terms and conditions and\\nprivacy policies.  \\n  \\n|  \\n---|---|---  \\n  \\n## How We Use Information\\n\\nWe use information about you to:\\n\\n  * Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;\\n  * Personalize services, content, and features that match your activities, preferences, and settings; \\n  * Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit User Agreement and our [other terms and policies](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/), as well as comply with applicable law; \\n  * Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services;\\n  * Research and develop new services;\\n  * Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and administrative messages; \\n  * Provide customer service;\\n  * Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, events, and programs, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about how to opt out of these communications, see ‚ÄúYour Choices‚Äù below); and \\n  * Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services.\\n\\n## How We Share Information\\n\\nIn addition to the content that is displayed publicly as described above, we\\nmay share information in the following ways:\\n\\n  * _With your consent_. We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction. For example, at your direction through social sharing features that allow you to share content with third party sites like Tumblr and X. \\n  * _With linked services_. If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control this sharing as described in \"Your Rights and Choices\" below. \\n  * _With our service providers_. We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us. Their use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. A few examples: (i) payment processors who process transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud providers who host our data and our services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers who help us and advertisers measure the performance of ads shown on our Services, and (iv) compliance providers who help us determine your eligibility to participate in Reddit Programs. \\n  * _To comply with the law_. We may share information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency) has additional information about how we respond to government requests. \\n  * _In an emergency_. We may share information if we believe it\\'s necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. \\n  * _To enforce our rights and promote safety and security_. We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User Agreement, [rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), or [other Reddit terms and policies](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/), or to protect the rights, property, and safety of the Services, ourselves, and others. \\n  * _With our affiliates_. We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. \\n  * _Aggregated or de-identified information_. We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were, or we may tell an advertiser how many people saw their ad. \\n\\n## How We Protect Your Information\\n\\nWe take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft,\\nmisuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For\\nexample, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce\\ntechnical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees\\nhave access to non-public personal information.\\n\\nYou can help maintain the security of your account by configuring [two-factor\\nauthentication](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-\\nreddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication).\\n\\nWe store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the\\npurpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain\\ninformation for legitimate business purposes and/or if we believe doing so is\\nin accordance with, or as required by, any applicable law. For example, if you\\nviolate our policies and your account is suspended or banned, we may store the\\nidentifiers used to create the account (such as phone number) to prevent you\\nfrom creating new accounts.\\n\\n## Your Rights and Choices\\n\\nYou have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and\\nsharing of information about you when you use the Services. Depending on where\\nyou live, you may also have the right to correction/rectification of your\\npersonal information, to opt out of certain advertising practices, or to\\nwithdraw consent for processing where you have previously provided consent.\\nBelow we explain how to exercise each of these rights. Reddit does not\\ndiscriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection\\nlaws.\\n\\n|  |  _Accessing and Changing Your Information_ |  |  You can access your information and change or correct certain information through the Services. See our [ Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/privacy-security/accessing-your-reddit-data/where-and-how-can-i-access-my-reddit-data) page for more information. You can also request a copy of the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described [ here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/privacy-security/accessing-your-reddit-data/how-do-i-request-copy-my-reddit-data-and).  |   \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n|  _Deleting Your Account_ |  |  You may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page. For more information, please visit our [Help Center](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/sections/360008917951-Deleting-Your-Reddit-Data). When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. After you submit a request to delete your account, our purge script commences the deletion process within 90 days. After running our purge script, Reddit will not be able to provide access to deleted data. We may also retain certain information about you for legitimate business purposes and/or if we believe doing so is in accordance with, or as required by, any applicable law.  |   \\n|  _Controlling Linked Services\\' Access to Your Account_ |  |  You can review the services you have permitted to access your account and revoke access to individual services by visiting your account‚Äôs [Apps page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) (for third-party app authorizations), the Connected Accounts section of your [Account Settings](https://www.reddit.com/settings) (for Google Sign-In, Sign in with Apple, and connected X accounts), and the Social links section of your [Profile Settings](https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile).  |   \\n|  _Controlling Personalized Advertising_ |  |  You may opt out of us using information we collect from third parties, including advertising partners, to personalize the ads you see on Reddit. To do so, visit the Privacy section of the User Settings in your account [here](https://www.reddit.com/settings/privacy), if using desktop, and in your Account Settings if using the Reddit mobile app.  |   \\n|  _Controlling the Use of Cookies_ |  |  Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. For more information on controlling how cookies and similar technologies are used on Reddit, see our [Cookie Notice](https://www.reddit.com/policies/cookies).  |   \\n|  _Controlling Advertising and Analytics_ |  |  Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) via the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). You can opt out of the Audience Measurement services provided by [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/#choices) and [Quantcast](https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out/).  You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the sites of the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!) and the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!), or if you are a user in the European Economic Area, [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).   \\n  \\n|  \\n|  _Do Not Track_ |  |  Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.  |   \\n|  _Controlling Promotional Communications_ |  |  You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/). If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.  |   \\n|  _Controlling Mobile Notifications_ |  |  With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.  |   \\n|  _Controlling Location Information_ |  |  You can control how we use location information for feed and recommendations customization via the [Location Customization](https://www.reddit.com/settings/account) setting in your Account Settings.  |   \\n  \\nIf you have questions or are not able to submit a request to exercise your\\nrights using the mechanisms above, you may also email us at\\n[redditdatarequests@reddit.com](mailto:redditdatarequests@reddit.com) from the\\nemail address that you have verified with your Reddit account, or submit them\\n[here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001370251).\\n\\nBefore we process a request from you about your personal information, we need\\nto verify the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified\\nemail address associated with your Reddit account. If we deny your request,\\nyou may appeal our decision by contacting us at\\n[redditdatarequests@reddit.com](mailto:redditdatarequests@reddit.com).\\n\\n## International Data Transfers\\n\\nReddit, Inc. is based in the United States and we process and store\\ninformation on servers located in the United States.

We believe there shouldn‚Äôt be\\nany surprises about the data we collect and how we use it ‚Äî that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre\\nupfront with how we process it. For example, we process your information to\\nprovide you a more personalized experience, including to show you content and\\ninformation that is most relevant to your experience, as well as more relevant\\nadvertisements. Understanding your interests and preferences help us provide a\\nbetter product experience.\\n\\nFurthermore, we believe a personalized experience should not come at the\\nexpense of your privacy. Just like in real life, there are some moments you\\nwant to share privately with your close friends, and others that you want to\\nshare publicly. That‚Äôs why from day one our philosophy has been to delete\\ncontent by default and to give Snapchatters control by providing the tools\\nthat allow them to decide what happens with their content, like who to share\\nit with or when to save it.\\n\\nThis Policy covers our Snapchat app as well as our other products, services,\\nand features, such as Bitmoji, Spectacles, and our advertising and commerce\\ninitiatives. When you read \"Services\" in this Policy, we‚Äôre talking about all\\nof them. Also, if you see us refer to our \"Terms,\" we mean the [Terms of\\nService](https://snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) that you agree to when you sign up\\nfor our Services. Finally, if you see the term \"Snapchatter\" we are often\\nusing that as shorthand for any user of our Services.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs get started with the controls you have over your information:\\n\\n###\\n\\nControl Over Your Information\\n\\n _Control over your information and settings is a core part of Snapchat\\nexperience. You can access, update, and delete your information, decide who\\ncan contact you, and download your data from within the Snapchat app. Below,\\nwe give you more details on the types of settings that are available, link out\\nto our data download tool, and provide instructions on how to delete data or\\nyour account._\\n\\nWe want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with a\\nrange of tools, including:\\n\\n  * **Access and update your information.** You can access and edit most of your basic account information right in our Services. Just navigate to your settings and you will see the options available to you.\\n\\n  * **Delete your information.** If you want to delete your account, learn how [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012328360596?lang=en-US). You can also delete some information within our Services, like content you‚Äôve saved to Memories, content you‚Äôve shared with My AI, Spotlight submissions, and more.\\n\\n  * **Control who can see your content.** We‚Äôve built a number of tools that let you choose who you share your content with. In some cases you may want to share content with your friends, and in other instances you may want to share it with the public. To learn more, go [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012343074580?lang=en-US).\\n\\n  * **Control who can contact you.** Snapchat is intended for close friends and family, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve built controls that help you decide who can contact you. If you receive unwanted communications, you can always [block](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012401093396?lang=en-US) and [report](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012399221652?lang=en-US) that person. Go [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012343074580?lang=en-US) to learn more.\\n\\n  * **Change your permissions.** In most cases, you can change your permissions at any time. For example, by default you are findable to others through your phone number and/or email address that you provided. If you no longer want to be findable, you can always change your settings. Or if you provided access to your phone or third party platform contacts to make friending easier, you can change that later on in your app settings. Of course, if you do that, certain features and Services, like finding friends in your contact book, won‚Äôt work.\\n\\n  * **Opt out of promotional messages.** You have the option to opt out or unsubscribe from promotional emails and messages sent by SMS or other messaging platforms. To do so, just follow the instructions in the message like an unsubscribe link or similar functionality.\\n\\n  * **Download your data.** You can make a request in our [Download My Data](https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/downloadmydata?lang=en-US) tool to export a copy of your Snapchat information.\\n\\n  * **Object to processing.** Depending on where you live and the particular data we are processing, you may have the right to object to our processing of that information. This gets a bit technical, so we‚Äôve explained it in more detail [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000016663&selectedAnswers=5749439348080640%2C5763539457277952&lang=en-US).\\n\\n  * **Set advertising preferences.** We try to show you ads that we think will be relevant to your interests, but if you‚Äôd like to have a less personalized experience, you can change your advertising settings in the Snapchat app. Learn more [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012345515796?lang=en-US).\\n\\n  * **Tracking.** If you use an iPhone with iOS 14.5 or above, some specific requirements apply, which we‚Äôve specified [here](/privacy/ads-privacy#controlling-ads).\\n\\n###\\n\\nInformation We Collect\\n\\n _This section provides you with details on what information we collect: what\\nyou provide to us, what we collect when you use Snapchat, and information we\\nreceive from other companies or apps you‚Äôve connected to your Snapchat\\naccount. Sometimes, we may also collect additional information, with your\\npermission._\\n\\nWhen you use our Services, such as Snapchat, we collect information you\\nprovide to us, generate information when you use our Services, and in some\\ncases receive data from others. Let‚Äôs break these down in more detail.\\n\\n**Information You Provide**\\n\\nMany of our Services require you to set up an account. To do this, we ask you\\nto provide us with _account details_ (information about you, like your name,\\nusername, email address, birthday, and phone number). When you set up your\\nprofile, you‚Äôll also provide us with _profile details_ (like your Bitmoji and\\nprofile picture). If you use our commerce products to buy something, like\\nthose latest sneakers, we may ask you for _payment and related information_\\n(like your physical address, so we can ship the product to you, payment\\ninformation, so we can process the payment, and transaction history).\\n\\nOf course, you‚Äôll also provide us with information you send through or save\\nwithin our Services, including content and information about that content, and\\ncontent you share and generate with our _AI Features_ (content, or ‚ÄúInputs,‚Äù\\nincluding text, images, video, audio, precise location, and engagement, used\\nto generate content and responses, or ‚ÄúOutputs‚Äù). We consider some of this\\ninformation to be _private content and communications_ (like Snaps and Chats\\nwith friends, voice and video calls, and content that is saved in My Eyes\\nOnly). Or content you share with a particular audience like _private & friend\\nstories_ (My Story set to Friends, Private Stories). On the other end of the\\nspectrum, some of the information you send through or save within our Services\\nmay be _public content_ that is accessible to everyone (such as Public Story\\ncontent, including My Story set to Everyone, Shared Stories, and Community\\nStories, Spotlight or Snap Map submissions, and Public Profile information).\\nKeep in mind that Snapchatters who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other\\ncontent, can always screenshot that content, save it, or copy it outside the\\nSnapchat app. So please don‚Äôt send messages or share content that you wouldn‚Äôt\\nwant someone to save or share.\\n\\nLastly, when you _contact Support_ (content and communications shared with\\nSupport) or our Safety team, or communicate with us in any other way,\\nincluding through our _research efforts_ (like responses to surveys, consumer\\npanels, or other research questions) we‚Äôll collect whatever information you\\nprovide or that we need to resolve your question.\\n\\n**Information We Generate When You Use Our Services**\\n\\nWhen you use our Services, we collect information about which of those\\nServices you‚Äôve used and how you‚Äôve used them. This helps us better understand\\nthe way our community uses our Services so that we can make improvements.\\n\\nThis includes _usage information_ (information about how you interact with our\\nServices ‚Äî for example, which Lenses you view and apply, your premium\\nsubscriptions, Stories you watch, and how often you interact with other\\nSnapchatters) and _content information_ (information about content you create\\nor provide, your engagement with the camera and creative tools, your\\ninteractions with My AI, and metadata ‚Äî for example, information about the\\ncontent itself like the date and time it was posted and who viewed it).\\n_Content information_ includes information based on the content of the image,\\nvideo, or audio ‚Äî so if you post a Spotlight of a basketball game, we may use\\nthat information to show you more content on Spotlight about basketball.\\n\\nThis also includes _device information_ (such as your hardware or software,\\noperating system, device memory, advertising identifiers, apps installed,\\nbrowser type, information from device sensors that measure the motion of your\\ndevice or compasses and microphones, including whether you have headphones\\nconnected, and information about your wireless and mobile connections),\\n_location information_ (IP address), _information collected by cookies and\\nsimilar technologies_ , depending on your settings, (cookies, _pixels_ (small\\ngraphic data that recognize user activity, such as if and how often a user has\\nvisited a website), web storage, unique advertising identifiers), and _log\\ninformation_ (such as details about how you‚Äôve used our Services, access\\ntimes, pages viewed, IP address, and unique identifiers like cookies).\\n\\nIf you‚Äôve explicitly granted device-level permissions, _device information_\\nmay also include information about your _device phonebook_ (contacts and\\nrelated information), images and other information from your device‚Äôs _camera,\\nphotos, and microphone_ (like the ability to take photos, videos, view stored\\nphotos and videos, and access the microphone to record audio while recording\\nvideo), and _location information_ (precise location through methods like GPS\\nsignals).\\n\\n**Data We Receive From Others**\\n\\nThe last category of data we collect is information about you that we may\\nreceive from others, such as other users, our\\n[affiliates](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7047492876308?lang=en-US),\\nand third parties. This includes _linked third-party service data_\\n(information we get when you link your Snapchat account to another service),\\n_data from advertisers_ (information from advertisers, app developers,\\npublishers, and other third parties to help target or measure the performance\\nof ads), _contact info from other Snapchatters or third parties_ (if another\\nSnapchatter uploads their contact list which includes your information, we may\\ncombine that with other information we have about you to better understand who\\nyou may want to communicate with. Or, if you provide us with your contact\\ninformation, we may use that to determine if we can communicate with you in\\nother ways, like SMS, email, or other messaging services), and _data relating\\nto potential violations of our Terms_ (we may receive information from third\\nparties, including website publishers, social network providers, law\\nenforcement, and others, about potential violators of our Terms of Service and\\nCommunity Guidelines).\\n\\n**Other Information, With Your Permission**\\n\\nAdditionally, there may be instances when you interact with our Services that\\nwe will ask your permission to collect additional information. For example,\\nbefore accessing your device‚Äôs camera roll or your device or third party\\ncontact book.\\n\\n###\\n\\nHow We Use Information\\n\\n _This section explains how we use the information we collect. Among other\\nthings, we use the information we collect to provide you with personalized\\nproducts and Services that we work hard to build and improve. Below, we walk\\nthrough each purpose for which we use information in detail. If you‚Äôd like to\\nsee a mapping of the data we collect with the purposes for which we collect\\nit, we have a table_[\\n_here_](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/22535044112532?utm_source=web&utm_medium=snap&utm_campaign=priv_prod&lang=en-\\nUS) _._\\n\\n**Keep Things Up & Running (i.e., operate, deliver, and maintain our\\nServices)**\\n\\nWe use the information we collect in order to operate, deliver, and maintain\\nour Services. For example, by delivering a Snap you want to send to a friend\\nor, if you share your location on Snap Map, to show you suggestions like\\nplaces you might like in your neighborhood, content others have posted to the\\nMap, or your friends if they‚Äôre sharing their location with you. We also use\\nsome of your information to help keep our products up to date, for example to\\nmake sure that our Services work with the latest operating systems and\\ndevices.\\n\\n**Personalize Your Experience & Give Context**\\n\\nWe offer personalized Services to Snapchatters. One of the ways we do this is\\nby showing you content that is relevant to you or we think you may enjoy based\\non the information you share with us. To do so, we use information about you\\nacross different areas of the Services in order to add context to your\\nSnapchat experience. For example, we automatically tag content with labels\\nbased on the content, your location, or the time of day. So if there\\'s a dog\\nin the photo, it may be searchable in Memories by the term ‚Äúdog,‚Äù show up on\\nthe Map at the location where you created the Memory, and inform us that\\nyou‚Äôre into dogs so we can surface you fun dog videos and dog food ads in\\nother parts of our Services, such as Spotlight.\\n\\nPersonalization can also help with suggesting friends or recommending a new\\nfriend to send a Snap to based on who you Snap with the most. We may show\\nrecommended places on the Snap Map, generate stickers, or even generate Snaps\\nand other content using AI, infer your interests based on your content or\\nactivity, or customize the content we show you, including ads. For example, if\\nyou watch barista content on Spotlight, talk to My AI about your favorite\\nespresso machine, or save a lot of coffee-related Snaps in your Memories, we\\nmay highlight coffee shops on the Snap Map when you visit a new city or show\\nyou content about coffee that you may find interesting or relevant. Or, if you\\ninteract with a lot of music venues we may use that to show you ads for\\nupcoming shows in town. Personalization also includes tailoring your\\nexperience based on who you interact with most and what your friends are\\ndoing, including showing you content your friends create, like, or enjoy on\\nSpotlight or Place recommendations that are popular with your friends.\\n\\nOur goal is to continuously provide you with more relevant and interesting\\ncontent.\\n\\nFor example, if you watch a lot of sports content, but skip content with hair\\nand makeup tips, our recommendation algorithms will prioritize sports, but not\\nthose makeup tips. You can learn more about how we understand Snapchatter\\npreferences and rank and moderate content\\n[here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/17338132910484?lang=en-US).\\n\\nWe believe it is critical to also balance the benefits of personalization with\\nour Snapchatters‚Äô expectations of privacy. For example, we may automatically\\ntag the Snaps you save to Memories based on the content within it (e.g., the\\nSnap contained a dog), and then use that tag to personalize your experience,\\nmake recommendations, or show you ads (such as showing you Spotlight Snaps\\ncontaining dogs). We do not use the _private content and communications_ you\\nsend to your friends to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or\\nshow you ads.\\n\\n**Provide Relevant Ads**\\n\\nAnother way we provide a personalized Service is through the ads we show. We\\nuse your interests and preferences from the information we‚Äôve collected to\\npersonalize, target, and measure ads. We think ads are best when they‚Äôre\\nrelevant. That‚Äôs why we try to select the right ads and show them to you at\\nthe right time. For example, if you‚Äôve interacted with ads for video games, we\\nwill infer that you like video games, and show you similar ads, but those\\nwon‚Äôt be the only ads you see. Similar to our content strategy, we try to\\nensure you receive a variety of ads. We also use your information to avoid\\nshowing you ads you probably won‚Äôt be interested in. For example, if a\\nticketing site tells us you‚Äôve previously bought tickets for a movie ‚Äî we can\\nstop showing you ads for it. You can learn about the different types of\\nadvertising and your choices about which ads you receive\\n[here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012345515796?lang=en-US).\\n\\nYou can learn more about how we collect, use, and share your information for\\nadvertising purposes [here](/privacy/ads-privacy).\\n\\nA note about _information collected by cookies and other technologies_ : we\\nmay use these technologies to collect information when you interact with\\nServices we offer through one of our partners. For example, we may use\\ninformation collected on an advertiser‚Äôs website to show you more relevant\\nads. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer,\\nyou can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your\\nbrowser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies\\ncould affect the availability and functionality of our Services. To learn more\\nabout how we and our partners use cookies on our Services and your choices,\\nplease check out our [Cookie Policy](https://www.snap.com/cookie-\\npolicy/?lang=en-US).\\n\\n**Develop & Improve Features, Algorithms & Machine Learning Models**\\n\\nOur teams are constantly coming up with new ideas for features and ways to\\nimprove our Services. In order to do this, we also develop and improve the\\nalgorithms and _machine learning models_ (an expression of an algorithm that\\ncombs through significant amounts of data to find patterns or make\\npredictions) that make our features and Services work, including through\\n_generative AI features_ (artificial intelligence capable of generating text,\\nimages, or other media, using generative models. Generative AI models learn\\nthe patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new\\ndata that has similar characteristics). We use algorithms and _machine\\nlearning models_ for personalization, advertising, safety and security,\\nfairness and inclusivity, augmented reality, and to prevent abuse or other\\nTerms of Service violations. For example, our algorithms and _machine learning\\nmodels_ take into account the conversations Snapchatters are having with My AI\\nto improve the responses from My AI.\\n\\nYour information can help us decide what kind of improvements we should make,\\nbut we are always focused on privacy ‚Äî and we don‚Äôt want to use more of your\\npersonal information than necessary to develop our features and models.\\n\\n**Analytics**\\n\\nIn order to understand what to build or how to improve our Services, we need\\nto understand trends and demand for our features. For example, we monitor\\nmetadata and trends about Group Chat use to help decide whether we should\\nchange parts of the feature, like the maximum size of a Group. Studying data\\nfrom Snapchatters can help us see trends in the ways that people use the\\nServices. This helps inspire us to improve Snapchat on a larger scale. We\\nperform analytics in order to identify, monitor, and analyze trends and usage.\\nBased on this information, we will, among other things, create information\\nabout our users to help us understand demand.\\n\\n**Research**\\n\\nWe conduct research to better understand general consumer interests, trends,\\nand how our Services are used by you and others in our community. This\\ninformation, along with analytics (as we described above), helps us understand\\nmore about our community and about how our Services fit into the lives of\\nthose in our community. We also engage in research and development to develop\\nnew techniques and technologies (e.g., new _machine learning models_ or\\nhardware, such as Spectacles). The results of our research are sometimes used\\nin features on Snapchat, and we sometimes publish papers about things like\\noverall behaviors and consumer trends (which will only have aggregated data\\nacross our user base, and not contain any private information about you\\nspecifically).\\n\\n**Enhance the Safety & Security of Our Services**\\n\\nWe use your information to enhance the safety and security of our Services,\\nverify Snapchatter identity, and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or\\nillegal activity. For example, we provide two-factor authentication to help\\nprotect your account and can send you email or text messages if we notice any\\nsuspicious activity. We also scan URLs sent on Snapchat to see if that webpage\\nis potentially harmful, and can give you a warning about it.\\n\\n**Contacting You**\\n\\nSometimes we‚Äôll get in touch with you to promote new or existing features.\\nThis includes sending Snapchatters communications through Snapchat, email,\\nSMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted. For example, we may use\\nthe Snapchat app, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms to share\\ninformation about our Services and promotional offers that we think may\\ninterest you.\\n\\nOther times, we need to communicate with you to provide information, alerts,\\nor to send messages our users ask us to deliver at their request. This may\\ninclude sending communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other\\nmessaging platforms, where permitted, to deliver account status updates,\\nsecurity alerts, and Chat or friending reminders; it may also include\\nfulfilling our user‚Äôs request to send invites or Snapchat content to non-\\nSnapchatters.\\n\\n**Support**\\n\\nWhen you ask for help, we want to get you support as quickly as possible. In\\norder to provide you, the Snapchatter community, and our business partners\\nwith the help needed to resolve issues with our Services, we often need to use\\nthe information we have collected to respond.\\n\\n**Enforce Our Terms & Policies**\\n\\nWe use the data we collect to enforce our Terms and the law. This includes\\nenforcing, investigating, and reporting conduct that violates our Terms,\\npolicies, or the law, responding to requests from law enforcement, and\\ncomplying with legal requirements. For example, when unlawful content is\\nposted on our Services, we may need to enforce our Terms and other policies.\\nIn some cases, we may also use or share your information to cooperate with law\\nenforcement requests, escalate safety issues to law enforcement, industry\\npartners, or others, or comply with our legal obligations. Check out our\\n[Transparency Report](/privacy/transparency) to learn more.\\n\\n**Other Purposes, With Your Permission**\\n\\nAdditionally, there may be instances when you interact with our Services that\\nwe will ask for your permission to use your information in a new, different,\\nor otherwise specific way.\\n\\n###\\n\\nHow We Share Information\\n\\n _This section explains who we share information with, what that information\\nmay include, and the reasons for sharing that information, including when we\\nneed to transfer it outside of the country it was collected from._\\n\\n**Recipients & Reasons for Sharing**\\n\\n  * **Snapchat.** To provide our Services to you and our community, we may share your information with your friends on Snapchat or other Snapchatters. For example, the content you post to Stories, or your status as a premium subscriber, can be viewed by your Friends if you allow them. See the [Control Over Your Information](/privacy/privacy-policy#control-over-your-information) section and your Settings for the controls you have over who sees what and when.\\n\\n  * **Family Center Participants.** When you have enabled Family Center, we share information about the connected teen account to the parent or guardian to provide insight about how the account is used, for example, who your Friends are on Snapchat or which friends you may be sharing your location with. We do not share message content. [Learn more](https://parents.snapchat.com/parental-controls?utm_source=GoogleSEM&utm_medium=PAIDSNAPCHATBRAND&utm_campaign=TandS_MaxClicks_2023&utm_term=ParentalControl&utm_content=ToolsandResources&gclid=Cj0KCQiAgqGrBhDtARIsAM5s0_maJyV4qT3Uma9lKM5k9KmbXxmRjSnfOMzXHVZ8NChkIzrkf_VnFGMaAvwUEALw_wcB&lang=en-US).\\n\\n  * **Public.** Most of the features on Snapchat are private and for Friends only, but we also offer public features that allow you to opt in to showcase your best Snaps to the world, such as Spotlight, Snap Map, or your Public Profile. When you do this, those Snaps may also be discoverable outside of Snapchat, for example on the web. Some information, like your username and Bitmoji, are visible to the public. [Learn more](/privacy/privacy-by-product).\\n\\n  * **Third-Party Apps.** Sometimes we provide features that allow you to connect with third-party apps. If you decide to connect your Snapchat account with a third-party app, we will share any additional information you direct us to.\\n\\n  * **Service Providers.** We share your information with our service providers, who process that information on our behalf. For example, we rely on such Service Providers to facilitate payments, measure and optimize the performance of ads, or protect the services. We do not share private communications with them. We maintain a list of categories of service providers [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012351145364?lang=en-US).\\n\\n  * **Business and Integrated Partners.** We share your information with business and integrated partners in order to provide the Services. For example, you can use OpenTable within Snapchat to reserve a table. This does not include private communications. We maintain a list of these partners [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012332511252?lang=en-US).\\n\\n  * **Anti-Fraud Partners.** We share your information, such as device and usage information, with industry partners working to prevent fraud.\\n\\n  * **Legal, Safety, and Security Partners.** We share your information as necessary for the following legal, safety, and security reasons:\\n\\n    * comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation.\\n\\n    * investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service and Community Guidelines violations.\\n\\n    * protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others.\\n\\n    * detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.\\n\\n  * **Affiliates.** Snap Inc. consists of different [subsidiaries](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7047492876308?lang=en-US) owned by us. We may share your information within those internal subsidiaries as needed to carry out our Services.\\n\\n  * **For the purposes of a Merger or Acquisition.** If we were to sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or possible buyer, we may transfer your information to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction.\\n\\n**Integrated Partners**\\n\\nOur Services may contain content and integrations offered by our integrated\\npartners. Examples include integrations in Lenses, Camera editing tools, to\\nprovide Scan results, and third-party developer integrations. Through these\\nintegrations, you may be providing information to the integrated partner as\\nwell as to Snap. We are not responsible for how those partners collect or use\\nyour information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies\\nof every third-party service that you visit or use, including those third\\nparties you interact with through our Services. You can learn more about our\\nintegrations in Snapchat\\n[here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012332511252?lang=en-US).\\n\\nOn iOS we use Apple‚Äôs TrueDepth camera to improve the quality of Lenses. Note,\\nhowever, that this information is used in real time ‚Äî we don‚Äôt store this\\ninformation on our servers or share it with third parties.\\n\\n**International Data Transfers**\\n\\nOur Services connect you with your friends around the world. To make that\\npossible, we may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and\\nstore and process it in the United States or other countries outside of where\\nyou live. Whenever we share information outside of where you live, we ensure\\nsafeguards are in place to protect the data as required by law where you live.\\nIf you want to learn more about this, see the [_Region Specific\\nInformation_](/privacy/privacy-policy#region-specific-information) section for\\nmore details.\\n\\n###\\n\\nHow Long We Keep Your Information\\n\\n _In this section we provide you with information on how long we keep your\\ninformation, why we keep your information, and also highlight how we may need\\nto keep your information to comply with laws, courts, and other obligations._\\n\\nAs a general rule, we keep information as long as you tell us to, and\\notherwise as long as we need it to provide our Services, or as required by\\nlaw. For example, if you store something in Memories, we will keep it as long\\nas you need it, but when you Chat with a friend, our systems are designed to\\ndelete Chats you send within 24 hours after your friend reads it (unless\\nyou‚Äôve changed your default settings or decide to save it). Whether we retain\\nyour data depends on the specific feature, your settings, and how you‚Äôre using\\nthe Services. Here are some more factors we consider when we decide how long\\nto keep your information:\\n\\n  * If we need the information to operate or provide our Services. For example, we store your basic _account details_ ‚Äî like your name, phone number, and email address ‚Äî to maintain your account.\\n\\n  * To do the things you expect from our Services and as we‚Äôve described within this Privacy Policy. For example, we maintain your list of friends until you ask us to delete them since friends are key to expressing yourself. Similarly, we keep your shared list of contacts until you ask us to remove them in our app settings (note: updating your device permissions may not remove the contacts you‚Äôve previously shared with Snapchat). [_Learn more_](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012328615828-How-to-Add-Friends-on-Snapchat?lang=en-US). Conversely, Snaps and Chats sent in Snapchat will be deleted by default from our servers within 24 hours after we detect they‚Äôve been opened by all recipients or have expired, unless you‚Äôve changed your default settings or decide to save something, in which case we will honor your choices.\\n\\n  * The information itself. For example, we store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which Services you use. If location information is associated with a Snap ‚Äî like those saved to Memories or posted to Snap Map or Spotlight ‚Äî we‚Äôll retain that location as long as we store the Snap.

This information is used to triage and fix potential issues, and\\ncontinuously improve your vehicle and services to you. To protect your\\nprivacy, by default, this vehicle data is either in a form that is not\\nassociated with your account or VIN, is stored in an encrypted format that\\nTesla cannot decrypt, or remains inaccessible unless a specific event is\\ntriggered:\\n\\n     * If your vehicle may require, or you otherwise request service or repair\\n     * If there is an occurrence of a safety event (such as vehicle collision, airbag deployment or emergency braking event)\\n     * If your vehicle requires safety services such as emergency response or Roadside Assistance\\n     * If your vehicle experiences a hardware or software issue which may be inspected and addressed through a future software update or other resolution\\n     * If you provide your consent, or another legal basis is applicable\\n\\n  \\nWe clearly define the vehicle data which we collect and don‚Äôt collect. Tesla\\ndoes not link your location with your account or identity, or keep a history\\nof where you‚Äôve been. Examples of the vehicle data collected include: speed\\ninformation, odometer readings, vehicle component signals, internet\\nconnectivity status, battery use management information, battery charging\\nhistory, electrical system functions, software version information,\\ninfotainment system data, safety-related data and camera images (including\\ninformation regarding the vehicle‚Äôs SRS systems, braking and acceleration,\\nsecurity, and e-brake); short video clips of accidents; information regarding\\nAutopilot engagements, Dumb Summon, Sentry and other features, and other data\\nto assist in identifying issues and analyzing the performance of the vehicle.\\n\\n> **Location Services:** Your Tesla vehicle uses location to power features\\n> such as in-vehicle maps, navigation, or mobile app location services.\\n> Location Services may use a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, IP address, and\\n> Wi-Fi and mobile towers to figure out where you are. To protect your\\n> privacy, location data is either processed directly without leaving your\\n> vehicle, is in a form that does not personally identify you, or remains\\n> inaccessible to Tesla. For safety purposes, your vehicle\\'s location may be\\n> used when you experience a safety event (such as a collision, an airbag\\n> deployment, or automatic emergency braking event) to aid response efforts.\\n> This means that unless captured as a result of a safety event‚Äî Tesla does\\n> not link your location to your identity or know where you‚Äôve been. You may\\n> also choose to enable or disable the collection of ‚ÄòRoad Segment Data\\n> Analytics‚Äô at any time within your vehicle‚Äôs touch screen by navigating to\\n> Software > Data Sharing. Please note, some advanced features such as real-\\n> time traffic and intelligent routing rely on such data.\\n>\\n> **Safety analysis data:** In order to help improve our products and\\n> services, we may collect and store other vehicle data that might contain\\n> information that identifies you or your vehicle‚Äôs VIN, including: data about\\n> accidents or near accident-like circumstances involving your Tesla vehicle\\n> (for example, Airbag deployment or automatic emergency braking event); data\\n> about remote services (for example, remote lock/unlock, start/stop charge,\\n> and honk-the-horn commands); a data report to confirm that your vehicle is\\n> online together with information about the current software version and\\n> certain telematics data; data about any issues that could materially impair\\n> operation of your vehicle; data about any safety-critical issues; and data\\n> about each software and firmware update.\\n>\\n> **Advanced features:** Certain features such as real-time traffic,\\n> navigation, intelligent routing, Autopilot, and Dumb Summon, may require\\n> road segment data to function as intended. To protect your privacy, you may\\n> enable or disable the collection of this data at any time (Software > Data\\n> Sharing). If enabled, we may share this data in a way that does not identify\\n> your account or VIN with partners in order to help us improve and provide\\n> the service to you. This sharing may occur even if you are not actively\\n> using a feature that needs this information.\\n>\\n> **Charging information:** We may collect information regarding the charge\\n> rate and charging stations used by you (including use of superchargers, as\\n> well as home or commercial outlets) in order to, for example, analyze which\\n> charging stations are being utilized, how long and efficient battery charges\\n> are, where additional charging stations are needed, and in some\\n> jurisdictions, participate in certain government incentive or credit\\n> programs.\\n>\\n> **Service history:** In order to facilitate the service and repair of your\\n> vehicle, we may collect and process data about the service history from\\n> Tesla service centers or affiliated third-party approved body shops. This\\n> includes information such as name, VIN, repair history, parts details,\\n> estimate and costs, outstanding recalls, bills due, customer complaints, and\\n> any other information related to the vehicle‚Äôs service history.\\n>\\n> **Opting out of vehicle data:** Connectivity and performance is a core part\\n> of all Tesla vehicles and why some customers choose Tesla, allowing for\\n> advanced features and an enhanced driving experience. By default, Tesla\\n> provides this seamless experience while protecting your privacy. However, if\\n> you no longer wish for us to collect vehicle data or any other data from\\n> your Tesla vehicle, please contact us to deactivate connectivity. Please\\n> note, certain advanced features such as over-the-air updates, remote\\n> services, and interactivity with mobile applications and in-car features\\n> such as location search, Internet radio, voice commands, and web browser\\n> functionality rely on such connectivity. If you choose to opt out of vehicle\\n> data collection (with the exception of in-car Data Sharing preferences), we\\n> will not be able to know or notify you of issues applicable to your vehicle\\n> in real time. This may result in your vehicle suffering from reduced\\n> functionality, serious damage, or inoperability.\\n\\n  2. **Diagnostic Data**\\n\\nTesla uses diagnostic logs to keep our products and services up to date,\\ntroubleshoot or debug problems, and make continuous improvements. We aim to\\ncollect the minimum level of diagnostic data necessary to help keep your\\nvehicle or energy product reliable, secure, and operating normally.\\nDiagnostics may include details about vehicle configuration, firmware, energy\\nuse, electronic systems state, and other system-to-system data used to\\nidentify bugs and conduct technical evaluations. On specific events, we use\\ndiagnostic logs as basic error information to help determine whether the\\nproblems experienced can be addressed by an immediate or future software\\nrelease.\\n\\n  3. **Infotainment System Data**\\n\\nWhen using your vehicle‚Äôs touchscreen, Tesla may collect certain usage\\nanalytics that are either stored on the vehicle itself, or if shared with us,\\nis not associated with your account or VIN by default. Usage analytics may\\ninclude, for example, aggregated counts of the features or apps used, playback\\nand browsing metadata (such as radio listening time and channel), and\\napproximate location for local radio options.\\n\\n  | **Processed directly on the vehicle by default** | **Shared with Tesla, but not associated with your account** | **Shared with Tesla and associated with your account**  \\n---|---|---|---  \\n**Calendar** | ‚úì | N/A | N/A  \\n**Phone** | ‚úì | N/A | N/A  \\n**Messages** | ‚úì | N/A | N/A  \\n**Contacts** | ‚úì | N/A | N/A  \\n**Browser** | ‚úì | N/A | N/A  \\n**Dashcam** | ‚úì | N/A | N/A  \\n**Sentry Mode** | ‚úì | N/A | N/A  \\n**Music Streaming** | ‚úì | Usage analytics for feature improvements | N/A  \\n**Video Calling** | ‚úì | Usage analytics for feature improvements | N/A  \\n**Smart Garage** | ‚úì | Usage analytics for feature improvements | N/A  \\n  \\n\\n\\nTo protect your privacy, your in-vehicle browser history and sign-in\\ncredentials are not shared with Tesla. For certain infotainment apps that\\nrequire sign-in, if you do not have your own account, Tesla offers the option\\nto use the app with a Tesla provisioned account instead. If you choose to use\\na Tesla provisioned account, then your infotainment system data for that\\nspecific app may be associated with your account or VIN. Additionally, if you\\nexperience performance issues with your infotainment and require support,\\nTesla may retrieve certain infotainment system data to fulfill your request,\\neffectively troubleshoot or debug the issue, and improve our products and\\nservices.\\n\\n> **Voice commands:** Each Tesla is equipped with the ability for you to use\\n> your voice to speak commands to the vehicle. To support ongoing quality\\n> improvements, Tesla captures and processes the transcription of the command\\n> (such as ‚Äúset the temperature‚Ä¶‚Äù). To protect your privacy, audio voice\\n> recordings are not captured, and the transcription of the command is not\\n> associated with your account or VIN. In addition, Tesla does not collect any\\n> information when using voice-to-text, as such your text messages are never\\n> sent to Tesla.\\n>\\n> **Tesla mobile app:** The Tesla app puts owners in direct communication with\\n> their vehicles. With the app, you have the capability to do things like\\n> check your vehicle\\'s charging progress in real time, start/stop charging,\\n> heat/cool the cabin before driving, lock/unlock the vehicle from afar, share\\n> destinations and calendar information, or view the vehicle‚Äôs current\\n> location. In order to detect and proactively fix issues related to the Tesla\\n> app‚Äôs functionality, address any customer complaints, and to prevent\\n> unauthorized access or misuse, certain general usage information associated\\n> with your account or VIN may be shared with us. For example, if you use the\\n> Tesla app to change the vehicle‚Äôs cabin temperature, we may collect that\\n> this command was successful or unsuccessful, without further details, such\\n> as the change in degrees. The Tesla app also allows you to upload images,\\n> for example, when submitting your service or repair request, for customer\\n> support assistance, product installations, to update your Tesla profile\\n> picture, and more.\\n\\n  4. **Autopilot Data**\\n\\nTesla vehicles make use of a camera suite that provides advanced features such\\nas Autopilot, Actually Smart Summon, and Autopark. Camera functionality has\\nbeen designed from the ground up to protect your privacy. Tesla does not\\ncapture continuous recordings or have live-view functionality. By default,\\nadvanced autonomous features that rely on the external cameras are processed\\nwithout ever leaving your vehicle. There are two types of camera recordings\\nthat are eligible to be transmitted from your vehicle to Tesla: Safety Event\\nand Fleet Learning camera recordings.\\n\\n    1. Safety Event camera recordings are automatically captured only if a serious safety event occurs such as a vehicle collision or airbag deployment. These short clips are up to 30 seconds and associated with your VIN in order to aid in providing emergency services, vehicle evaluation, and Roadside Assistance (and such recordings may include timestamp and location metadata).\\n    2. Fleet Learning camera recordings use the vehicle‚Äôs external cameras to learn how to recognize things like lane lines, street signs and traffic light positions. The more fleet learning of road conditions we are able to do, the better your Tesla‚Äôs self-driving ability will become. We want to be very clear that in order for Fleet Learning camera recordings to be shared with Tesla, your consent for Data Sharing is required and can be controlled through the vehicle‚Äôs touchscreen at any time by navigating to Software> Data Sharing. Even if you choose to opt-in, the camera recordings are limited to 30 seconds and remain anonymous, ensuring it‚Äôs not linked to you or your vehicle.\\n\\n> **Dashcam:** Dashcam is a feature available to customers, provided a\\n> properly configured USB drive is used. All recorded video is stored locally\\n> on the USB drive and not transmitted to Tesla. Before enabling this feature,\\n> please remember to consult your country‚Äôs local laws related to dashcam\\n> usage in order to comply with all regulations and property restrictions.\\n>\\n> **Sentry Mode:** This feature uses the vehicles sensors and external cameras\\n> to detect and notify you when there is suspicious activity or a significant\\n> threat to your vehicle while parked. If a threat is detected, such as\\n> someone leaning on the car, Sentry Mode will flicker the headlights, display\\n> a message on the touchscreen indicating that the cameras are recording, and\\n> save footage of the event to your USB drive (if installed). Sentry Mode\\n> footage is not transmitted to Tesla. For significant threats, such as a\\n> window break-in, the vehicle will also send an alert to the mobile app\\n> paired with the car, activate the security alarm, and generate a loud\\n> unexpected sound from the audio system. Sentry Mode footage is saved to\\n> onboard memory and can be viewed directly from the vehicle‚Äôs touchscreen.\\n> Sentry Mode can also operate in a similar manner without a USB drive\\n> installed, with the ability to send you an alert to your phone if a threat\\n> is detected ‚Äî however, footage of the event would not be available.\\n>\\n> If you have enabled Sentry Mode Live Camera Access, this allows you to\\n> remotely view your car\\'s surroundings while in park, and also honk, flash\\n> headlights, and talk through the car‚Äôs speaker. Audio from the car‚Äôs\\n> surroundings is not recorded. To enable or disable, tap Controls > Safety &\\n> Security. When in use, the car\\'s headlights will pulse and the touchscreen\\n> will show Sentry Mode is activated. Live Camera is end-to-end encrypted and\\n> cannot be accessed by Tesla.\\n>\\n> Please note it is your sole responsibility to consult and comply with all\\n> local regulations and property restrictions regarding the use of cameras.\\n>\\n> **Cabin Camera:**  [Eligible](/support/vehicle-safety-security-features)\\n> Tesla vehicles are equipped with a cabin camera located above the rearview\\n> mirror. Cabin camera is off by default unless enabled by you when using an\\n> associated safety or convenience feature (such as Autopilot or Dog Mode).\\n> When Autopilot is engaged the cabin camera can determine driver\\n> inattentiveness and provide you with audible alerts, to remind you to keep\\n> your eyes on the road. You can view which features you have granted\\n> permission to use cabin camera at any time (Controls > Software > Cabin\\n> Camera). To improve features that rely on cabin camera, you can choose to\\n> opt-in and share Cabin Camera Analytics (Controls > Software > Data Sharing)\\n> with Tesla. To protect your privacy, even if you opt-in to sharing this\\n> information, this camera data is not associated with your account or VIN.\\n> You may change this setting at any time.\\n>\\n> **Sound Detection** : Tesla vehicles are equipped with sound detection\\n> technology. Before features can use the microphone for sound detection, the\\n> vehicle will request your permission. Features that rely on sound detection,\\n> process the data on the car itself by default. Meaning the system cannot\\n> save or transmit information unless data sharing is enabled. Tesla does not\\n> capture continuous recordings and does not have live-listening\\n> functionality.\\n>\\n> You can opt-in and share sound detection data (up to 1 minute in duration)\\n> with Tesla to improve the intelligence of safety and convenience features\\n> like emergency vehicle detection, Voice Commands, or in the occurrence of a\\n> safety critical event. To adjust your data sharing preferences, navigate to\\n> Controls > Software> Data Sharing > Allow Sound Detection Analytics. Note,\\n> it is your responsibility to confirm consent of occupants. Even if you\\n> choose to opt-in, to protect your privacy, sound detection data is not\\n> associated with your account or VIN.\\n\\n[]()\\n\\n## How We May Use Your Information\\n\\nWe may use the information we collect to:\\n\\n  1.

Tumblr is a subsidiary of\\n[Automattic](https://automattic.com/), a technology company that empowers\\npeople to build beautiful websites, tell their stories, and find and grow\\ntheir audience. The way we handle your information hasn‚Äôt changed, so this\\nPrivacy Policy still governs when you are on Tumblr, using a Tumblr app or\\ninteracting with our products, services or technologies. We may share non-\\npersonal information with our family companies for purposes such as product\\nimprovements, research and analysis, and to help them provide you with more\\nrelevant experiences. When you use the Services, you also consent to the\\ncollection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your\\ninformation as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.\\n\\n## What This Privacy Policy Covers\\n\\nThis Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are\\nusing or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment\\nof any information about you that our partners share with us or that we share\\nwith our partners.\\n\\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we\\ndo not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party\\nwebsites, services, applications, or businesses (‚Äú**Third Party Services** ‚Äù).\\nThis includes third parties you provide with information about yourself as\\npart of enabling or using a Tumblr feature. While we try to work only with\\nthose Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don\\'t\\ntake responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party\\nServices. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all\\nThird Party Services you access.\\n\\nAlso: This Privacy Policy doesn‚Äôt govern what our users do on their Tumblr\\nblogs and we aren\\'t responsible for the information collection and use\\npractices of our individual blogs and bloggers. One of the great features of\\nTumblr\\'s products is customizability, and bloggers have a lot of flexibility\\nin how their blogs behave. When you visit a blog in our network, that blog may\\ncollect more information than we do, and may provide information to third\\nparties that we have no relationship with, including to advertisers.\\n\\n## What We Collect and How We Use It\\n\\n**Account Information:** When you create an account on the Services (an\\n\"**Account** \"), we‚Äôll ask you for information such as your username,\\npassword, age, and email address (‚Äú**Account Information** ‚Äù). We may use\\nAccount Information, alone or together with other information, to enhance and\\nimprove the Services, such as by personalization. We use your age to verify\\nthat you can lawfully use the Services. We use your email address to verify\\nyour Account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below.\\n\\nYou can keep yourself fairly anonymous on Tumblr, but remember that your\\nposts, blogs, pages, and username are all visible to the public by default.\\n\\n**Email Communications with Us:** As part of the Services, you may\\noccasionally receive email and other communications from us. Administrative\\ncommunications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account\\nrecovery or password reset) are considered part of the Services and your\\nAccount, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. We also may send\\nyou other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of either from your Account\\nSettings page or by using the ‚ÄúOpt-Out‚Äù link in the emails themselves. **Note\\nthat we will _never_ email you to ask for your password or other Account\\nInformation; if you receive such an email, please [forward it to\\nus](/support).**\\n\\nWe send two kinds of email: ones about fun stuff happening on Tumblr, and ones\\nwith important information about your account. You can opt out of the former,\\nbut not the latter.\\n\\n**Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services:** You can link your\\nAccount to certain Third Party Services. In order to do so, you may provide us\\nwith your username or other user ID for a Third Party Service, and you may\\nthen be required to log into that Service. After you complete this login\\nprocess, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on that\\nservice so that we can, for example, post your content to that service when\\nyou ask us to. We do not receive or store your passwords for your Third Party\\nService accounts.\\n\\n**Information Obtained from Third Party Services:** In some cases, we partner\\nwith Third Party Services that may provide information about you. Such\\ninformation could include, for example, your gender, if you have disclosed\\nthat information to that third party and made it available for Tumblr to\\naccess. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use it to develop new\\nServices or to improve or enhance the Services.\\n\\nWhen you connect other services to your Tumblr account, those services might\\nshare information about you with us. What gets shown to us is determined by\\ntheir privacy policies, which are long and boring, but which you should\\nprobably read if you have questions or concerns.\\n\\n**User Content:** By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and\\nwhen you provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it.\\nAlthough we do provide tools, like password-protected blogs, Asks, and Fan\\nMail, that let you publish content privately, you should assume that anything\\nyou publish is publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected\\notherwise. Also, please keep in mind that anything you share privately with\\nanother user, particularly through an Ask, Fan Mail, or submitted post, may be\\nposted publicly by that user. Content published and shared publicly is\\naccessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy\\nrights you might have regarding that content. In addition, information shared\\npublicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through\\nactions or features native to the Services, such as reblogging.\\n\\nAt its heart, Tumblr is a public platform. Don‚Äôt be afraid to share amazing\\nthings, but do understand that it can be hard to completely remove things from\\nthe internet once they‚Äôve been reblogged a few times.\\n\\n**Native Actions:** The Services allow you to perform native actions that are\\nintegral to our products, such as liking a post, reblogging a post, replying\\nto a post, and following a blog. Liking, reblogging, and replying are public\\nactions ‚Äì anyone can expand the ‚Äúnotes‚Äù view on a post, for example, to see\\nwho liked, reblogged, or replied to a post. We use information about native\\nactions to improve the Services, develop new Services, and, particularly, to\\npersonalize your Tumblr experience. Personalization using this information may\\ninclude presenting you with new posts relevant to what you‚Äôve liked, providing\\nyou with better search results, and showing you advertising more relevant to\\nyour interests.\\n\\nReblogs, Likes, and Replies are a matter of public record, so if you‚Äôre truly\\nashamed of your desires it‚Äôs best to keep them to yourself. But why? Be proud\\nof who you are. You‚Äôre beautiful. We‚Äôre looking you in the eyes and telling\\nyou how beautiful you are.\\n\\n**Information About User Content:** In some cases, we may collect information\\nabout content you provide to the Services. For example, when it\\'s included as\\npart of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera\\nsettings, or [EXIF\\ninformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format).\\nThis information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional\\nfeatures and functionality.\\n\\n**Contact and Financial Information** : There are various ways in which you\\nmay provide us financial information and contact information. For example, if\\nyou buy something from us (like Blaze, Premium Themes, or a domain name), or\\nearn revenue through your site, you provide additional personal and payment\\ninformation like your name, credit card information, and contact information.\\nWe may also keep a record of the purchases you‚Äôve made. You may also provide\\nus with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email\\naddress for your Stripe account.\\n\\nWe do not, however, store that financial information; such information is\\nstored by our payment processor (the \"**Payment Processor** \"). Please note\\nthat if you use the Payment Processor‚Äôs services, your data will be handled in\\naccordance with the Payment Processor‚Äôs privacy policy and practices. They\\nhave their own rules about information collection, use, storage, and sharing,\\nwhich you should review before using the Payment Processor‚Äôs services. We do\\nreceive certain information from our Payment Processor: (1) a unique token\\nthat we connect with your Account to enable you to make further purchases\\nusing the information stored by our Payment Processor and (2) in certain\\ncases, the last four digits of the credit card number associated with that\\ntoken, so that we can prevent fraudulent transactions and identity theft.\\n\\n**Information Related to Use of the Services:** We collect information about\\nhow people use the Services, including those with an Account. This type of\\ninformation may be collected in our log files each time you interact with\\n(i.e., make a request to) the Services. We use internal tools and third party\\napplications and services (like Google Analytics or comScore) to collect and\\nanalyze this information. Some of this information may also be associated with\\nthe Internet Protocol Address (‚Äú**IP Address** ‚Äù) used to access the Services;\\nsome may be connected with your Account; and some may only be collected and\\nused in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldn‚Äôt identify you or\\nyour Account). We also collect your IP Address when you make a post,\\nparticularly when you submit an anonymous ‚ÄúAsk.‚Äù We may use this information\\nabout how you and others interact with the Services for a number of things\\ngenerally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new\\nServices, including but not limited to: providing users with personalized\\ncontent; providing users with targeted advertising; improving our search\\nresults; identifying trending or popular content; fighting spam, malware,\\nidentity theft and generally keeping our users and community safe; and for\\nlegal and safety reasons as set forth in ‚ÄúInformation Disclosed for Our\\nProtection and the Protection of Others.‚Äù\\n\\nWe use information about how you interact with Tumblr in order to personalize\\nit for you, to keep both you and our community safe from harm, and to improve\\nTumblr for everyone who uses it.\\n\\n**Information Related to Your Web Browser:** We automatically receive and\\nrecord information from your web browser when you interact with the Services,\\nsuch as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your\\noperating system and version, your language preference, the website or service\\nthat referred you to the Services, the date and time of each request you make\\nto the Services, your screen display information, and information from any\\ncookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also\\nsometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and\\nstore that information in a manner associated with your Account. We use web\\nbrowser-related information to enhance and improve the Services.\\n\\n**Location Information:** In some cases we collect and store information about\\nwhere you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough\\ngeolocation. We may also ask you to provide information about your location,\\nfor example to use your geolocation information from your mobile device to\\ngeotag a post. We may use location information to improve and personalize the\\nServices for you, for example by showing you relevant local content.\\n\\nTumblr may determine your location by using drone technology and live video\\nfeeds. Ha ha, no, we just check out your [IP\\naddress](http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/navigatingthenet/f/IP-Addresses-\\nExplained.htm) or any location data you attach to a post. Normal stuff.\\n\\n**Information Related to Your Mobile Device:** We may collect and store\\ninformation related to your mobile device. In some cases, we may receive,\\ngenerate, or assign your mobile device a unique identifier for the purposes\\ndescribed above in ‚ÄúInformation Related to Use of the Services.‚Äù We may also\\nask you to provide your phone number to enable new products and improve the\\nServices, such as by enabling multi-factor authentication for Account login.\\nWe will always ask you whether it‚Äôs OK for us to collect and store your phone\\nnumber.\\n\\n**Information Collected Using Cookies and Other Technologies:** A cookie is a\\nstring of information that a website stores on a visitor‚Äôs computer, and that\\nthe visitor‚Äôs browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\\nPixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on\\nwebsites that allow Tumblr or a third party to see that you have looked at\\nthat page. We use cookies and web tags to enable our servers to recognize your\\nweb browser and tell us how and when you use the Services. Some services that\\nwe use (including Third Party Services), such as Google Analytics, Nielsen,\\nand comScore, may use their own web tags or place their own cookies on your\\nbrowser. If you are a Tumblr user in the EU, UK, Canada, or in some US states\\nyou can customize your cookie preferences from your [privacy\\nsettings](https://www.tumblr.com/settings/privacy).\\n\\nCookies and web tags let us learn how people use Tumblr, which in turn helps\\nus make a better product for you to use. Tumblr gives you some choices over\\nwhich cookies we set and how we use your data.\\n\\n**Information About Your Contacts:** Certain features of the Services allow\\nyou to provide us with your contact lists, so that we can connect you with\\npeople in our Services that are also on those contact lists. For example, you\\ncan temporarily connect your email contact information to your Account, so\\nthat we can provide you with a list of your email contacts that use the\\nServices. As another example, you can send us your mobile phone contact\\ninformation through our mobile applications, which then allows us to provide\\nyou with a list of those contacts that use the Services so that you can\\n‚Äúfollow‚Äù their blogs. We will give you a choice as to whether or not you\\nprovide us such information, and we will disclose fully, within the\\nappropriate feature, how we use that information.\\n\\nWe won‚Äôt look at (or be able to look at) your contact list unless you ask us\\nto. Why would you ask us to? Because that‚Äôs how you would find out if any of\\nyour contacts are on Tumblr. We discard this information immediately\\nafterward.\\n\\n**Derived Information:** As described above in ‚ÄúNative Actions‚Äù and\\n‚ÄúInformation Related to Use of the Services,‚Äù we analyze your actions on the\\nServices in order to derive or infer characteristics that may be descriptive\\nof your Account (for example, what kinds of blogs you follow or what kinds of\\nposts you view, like, or reblog). We use this information for all of the\\npurposes set forth in ‚ÄúInformation Related to Use of the Services,‚Äù above.\\n\\n## Personalized Advertising on Tumblr\\n\\nIn order to provide you with all of this Tumblr content for free, Tumblr\\nselectively runs advertisements. We, and our parent company, Automattic, work\\nwith online advertising companies to provide you with advertising that is as\\nrelevant and useful as possible. To make our ads more relevant and useful, we\\nmake educated guesses about your interests based on your activity on our sites\\nand services. The ads we show you often reflect these interests and educated\\nguesses.\\n\\nTo learn more about how we select the ads you see, you can check out [\\nTumblr‚Äôs\\nAdvertising](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360035272334-Tumblr-ads-\\nyou) and affiliate policies.\\n\\n**Managing your choices for personalized advertising experiences** : In some\\ngeographic locations, Tumblr users have the legal right to opt-out of having\\nads personalized to them. Note that if you opt-out you will continue to see\\nadvertisements on Tumblr, though they will be less relevant and useful to you.\\n\\nIf you are a Tumblr user in the EU, UK, Canada, or in some US states you can\\ncustomize your advertising preferences from within your [privacy\\nsettings](https://www.tumblr.com/settings/privacy).\\n\\nWhen using the mobile app version of Tumblr on Apple iOS devices you can also\\nopt out of personalized advertising by selecting \"Limit Ad Tracking\" in the\\niOS settings. For more information about these iOS options:\\n\\n  1. Open Settings;\\n  2. Select Privacy; and\\n  3. Select Advertising and follow the on-screen instructions.\\n\\nWhen using the mobile app version of Tumblr on Android devices you can opt-out\\nof personalized advertising by selecting \"Opt out of Interest Based Ads‚Äù in\\nGoogle settings. For more information about these Android options:\\n\\n  1. Open Settings;\\n  2. Select Google;\\n  3. Select Privacy; and\\n  4. Select Ads and follow the on-screen instructions.\\n\\nMore information about options for hiding, reporting, and controlling the ads\\nyou see on Tumblr can be found in our [Tumblr Ads &\\nYou](https://help.tumblr.com/hc/articles/360035272334-Tumblr-Ads-You) support\\ndoc.\\n\\n## With Whom Your Information Is Shared\\n\\nWe never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your\\npermission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice that\\nthe information will be shared, and with whom (such as in this Privacy\\nPolicy); or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information\\nthat does not identify you.\\n\\n**Information Shared with and Received from our Corporate Parents:** We are a\\nwholly-owned subsidiary of Automattic, and a member of the Automattic family\\nof companies. Because we are a wholly-owned subsidiary, Automattic and the\\nrest of our family of companies may receive any information we do, and may\\nshare information they have with us. Our family of companies may use the\\ninformation they receive from us to help us provide, understand, and improve\\nthe Services (including by providing us analytics) and in connection with\\ntheir products and services (including by providing you with a more\\npersonalized experience). For details about how Automattic treats the\\ninformation it collects, please review this [Privacy\\nPolicy](https://automattic.com/privacy/).\\n\\nAutomattic owns us and we share with it and the Automattic family of\\ncompanies.\\n\\n**Information Shared with the Public Through the Services:** As noted in ‚ÄúUser\\nContent‚Äù and ‚ÄúNative Actions,‚Äù above, by default, content published through\\nthe Services and many actions you take on the Services are shared with the\\npublic. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be\\nindexed by search engines, you should be careful about what you choose to\\ndisclose publicly and make sure it‚Äôs information you want to share with\\neveryone.\\n\\nThe content you create on Tumblr is, by default, public. This means that\\nanyone can see it, and that search engines can index it. If these things\\nbother you, take a look at some of the additional [ privacy\\nfeatures](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/articles/115011611747-Privacy-options)\\nwe offer.\\n\\n**Information Shared Between the Services:** We may, if possible, aggregate\\ninformation about your use of multiple Services and use that consolidated\\ninformation to enhance and improve the Services, and to develop new Services.\\n\\n**Information You Share with Third Party Services:** You may access Third\\nParty Services through the Services, for example by clicking on externally-\\npointing links. You may also choose to share information that you provide to\\nus, like blog posts, with those Third Party Services (for example, by sharing\\nposts to Twitter or Facebook). This Privacy Policy only governs information we\\ncollect and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third\\nParty Services\\' privacy policies.\\n\\nYou can automatically publish the posts you make on Tumblr to other sites\\n(like Facebook or Twitter). That‚Äôs where our Privacy Policy ends and their\\npolicies begin. Make sure you‚Äôre cool with the policies of any services you‚Äôre\\nconsidering sharing to before connecting them to your Tumblr account.\\n\\n**Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the\\nServices:** In some cases, we share information we store (such as IP\\naddresses) with third parties, such as service providers, consultants, and\\nother agents (\"**Agents** \"), for the purposes of operating, enhancing, and\\nimproving the Services, and developing new products and services. For example,\\nwe may share information with service providers that help us fight spam,\\npayment providers that process your credit and debit card information,\\ncustomer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you\\n(hey there!), registrars and registries that allow us to provide domain\\nregistration services, analytics providers that help us understand and improve\\nour services, and third party partners that pitch in on our marketing efforts\\n(like identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing\\ncampaigns, and by placing ads to market our services), along with third-party\\nconsultants who may have access to information in the process of improving our\\nprocesses and technology. Agents with whom we share such information for these\\nreasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell\\nyou differently, our agents do not have any right to use information we share\\nwith them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us.\\n\\n**Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:** In some cases, we\\nmay choose to buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, user\\ninformation is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if\\nwe, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of\\nbusiness or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that\\nis transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such\\ntransfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to\\nuse your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.\\n\\nShould we happen to get acquired (again!) or go out of business (no way), the\\ntransfer of assets from us to our buyer may very well include user\\ninformation. They are allowed to use it only in the ways outlined here, in the\\nPrivacy Policy you are reading right now.\\n\\n**Information Disclosed to Comply With Legal and Regulatory Requirements:** We\\nbelieve in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to\\nprotect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we may disclose\\ninformation about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other\\ngovernmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for\\ninformation about Tumblr users, please see our [Law Enforcement\\nGuidelines](https://help.tumblr.com/hc/articles/231925668-Law-Enforcement-\\nGuidelines). Additionally, if you have a domain registered with us, we may\\nshare your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned\\nNames and Numbers‚Äô (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies. For example, your\\ninformation relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS\\ndatabase, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved\\nDispute Resolution Service Providers. Please see our [Domain Registrations and\\nPrivacy](https://help.tumblr.com/hc/articles/14449316040087#privacy) support\\ndocument for more details.\\n\\n**Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:** We\\nreserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we\\nreasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any\\nlaw, regulation, or governmental request, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and\\nour [Terms of Service](https://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/terms-of-service),\\nincluding investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent,\\nor otherwise address fraud, security, trust and safety, or technical issues\\n(including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for\\nthe purposes of improving security and preventing fraud, spam, and malware),\\n(iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property,\\nhealth or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the public in general,\\nincluding but not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide,\\nor self-harm.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt make us narc on you. We don‚Äôt want to. But we do need to protect\\neveryone who uses Tumblr from harming us, each other, or themselves. We work\\nhard to balance privacy and community, and we‚Äôre sure you can appreciate the\\nchallenges in that, and the seriousness with which we take those challenges.\\n\\n**Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request:** If you ask us\\nto release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if\\nreasonable and not unduly burdensome.\\n\\n**Information Shared with Other Third Parties:** We may share or disclose non-\\nprivate information, Aggregate Information, or other non-personally\\nidentifying information with people and entities that we do business with.\\n\\n## Security and Retention of Your Information\\n\\nYour Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and\\nsecurity. We may enable additional security features in the future, like\\nmulti-factor authentication. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your\\nAccount and information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password\\nand limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have\\nfinished accessing your Account on the Services.\\n\\nWe seek to protect your information (including your Account Information) to\\nensure that it is kept private; however, we can\\'t guarantee the security of\\nany information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and\\nother factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs really important that you have a unique password for all of your accounts\\non the internet, including your Tumblr account. If you have trouble\\nremembering passwords then you might consider using a service like\\n[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) or\\n[LastPass](https://lastpass.com/).\\n\\nTumblr will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the\\npurposes set out in this Privacy Policy, for as long as your Tumblr account is\\nactive or as needed to provide you with the Services. If you no longer want\\nTumblr to use your information to provide you with the Services, you may close\\nyour account and Tumblr will delete the information it holds about you unless\\nwe need to retain and use your information to comply with our legal\\nobligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements or as otherwise\\npermitted by law.\\n\\n## What Information You Can Access\\n\\nIf you are a registered user, you can download a personal data report by\\nsubmitting a request in the Privacy section of your Settings. You need to be\\nsigned in to your Tumblr account to submit this request, and you will have to\\nlog in to your account to access the summary or the report. You can also\\n[download/export a copy of the content you post to\\nTumblr.](https://help.tumblr.com/export-your-blog/)\\n\\n## How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account\\n\\nIf you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your [Account\\nSettings](/settings/account). Deleting your Account may not fully remove the\\ncontent you have published from our systems, as caching of, backups of, copies\\nof, or references to your Account Information may not be immediately removed.\\nIn addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, some of the public\\nactivity on your Account prior to deletion (such as reblogs of your blog\\nposts) may remain stored on our servers and accessible to the public.\\n\\nYou‚Äôll do great things on Tumblr, surely, but if it ever comes time to say\\ngoodbye, then you‚Äôre free to delete your account at any time and for any\\nreason. The deletion will be effective immediately, for the most part, but it\\nmight take a little while to scrub everything from our archives and backups.\\n\\nWhat won‚Äôt get scrubbed are Reblogs of your posts. Those will remain on\\nwhatever blog reblogged them. Like we said before, it can be really, really\\nhard to delete something once it goes out onto the internet, so be sure you‚Äôre\\nonly publishing stuff that you‚Äôre certain you want to publish.\\n\\n## Privacy Rights\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre a resident of Canada and certain US states you have a number of\\nrights and choices about your personal information. To learn more, see the\\napplicable [Supplemental US Privacy Notice](/privacy/en#supplemental) or\\n[Supplemental Canadian Privacy Notice](/privacy/en#supplemental-ca) below.\\n\\n## Changes to This Privacy Policy\\n\\nWe may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process for\\nmodifications set forth in our [Terms of Service](/policy/en/terms-of-\\nservice). Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in\\neffect at the time such information is collected.\\n\\n## Where to Direct Questions or Concerns\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services,\\n[send us a detailed message](/support).\\n\\n## Link to Prior Versions\\n\\nYou will find a link to prior versions of our Privacy Policy below.

You can delete much of your information by logging in to your account. If you cannot do this, or you do not have a Tumblr account, please submit a support ticket [here](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=12913521777175), or email us at privacy@tumblr.com.

For example, you can update your email address from [your account settings](https://www.tumblr.com/settings/account). If there‚Äôs any information we have about you that you would like corrected, that you can‚Äôt change yourself, you can [contact our support team](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=12913521777175) to request this. \\n  * **Opt-Out:** You may have the right to opt-out of having your data sold or shared (as those terms are defined in your state‚Äôs law). More on how to do that below. \\n  * **Content Portability:** At Tumblr it‚Äôs totally possible to [export your blog](https://help.tumblr.com/hc/articles/360005118894-Export-Your-Blog). It‚Äôs your stuff, not ours. We make it easy for you to grab a copy of it. \\n\\nCertain information may be exempt from these rights under applicable law. For\\nexample, we need certain types of information so that we can provide you with\\nthe Services. If you ask us to delete them, you may no longer be able to\\naccess or use the Services.\\n\\nBefore we can satisfy your request, you‚Äôll need to give us enough information\\nso that we can be certain of your identity. To do that, you‚Äôll need to log in\\nto your account or give us certain information about you and/or your use of\\nthe Services. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on\\nyour behalf. To do so, you have to give us written authorization for the agent\\nto act on your behalf. You‚Äôll still need to verify your identity directly with\\nus.\\n\\n**Right to Opt-Out:** Tumblr selectively runs advertisements so we can provide\\nyou with Tumblr content for free. To help select which ads to show you, we may\\nshare some of your information with advertising partners, or allow our\\nadvertising partners to ‚Äúcollect‚Äù certain information. The personal\\ninformation we share includes online identifiers and internet or other network\\nor device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and\\nIP address), and geolocation data (approximate location information from your\\nIP address). In some US states, this data sharing may be considered a ‚Äúsale.‚Äù\\nTo learn more about how we select the ads you see, check out [Tumblr‚Äôs Ads &\\nYou](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360035272334-Tumblr-ads-you). We\\ndo not sell (or share) information that identifies you personally, like your\\nname or contact information, in our ads program. Also, we do not knowingly\\n\"sell\" your personal information if you are under 16.\\n\\nLearn how you can opt out by going to [Your Advertising\\nChoices](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360041012973). If you are a\\nuser who has told us you are under 16, you‚Äôll see in [your\\nsettings](/settings/privacy) that we‚Äôve already opted you out.\\n\\nIn addition to the data sharing related to our ads program, sometimes Tumblr\\nshares your information with our third-party service providers to provide our\\nservices to you. To the extent that we share your information with certain\\nadvertising, marketing, or analytics vendors, this can be considered a \"sale\"\\nor ‚Äúshare‚Äù in certain U.S. States, which you may have the right to opt out of.\\nThis opt-out is controlled through the same opt-out as the personalized ads\\nprogram opt-out, found in [your\\nsettings](https://www.tumblr.com/settings/privacy). We also respect the GPC\\nbrowser signal and will treat it as a valid means of communicating your desire\\nto opt out.\\n\\nWe do not collect or process your sensitive (and potentially sensitive)\\npersonal information except where it is strictly necessary to provide you with\\nour service, where the processing is not for the purpose of inferring\\ncharacteristics about you, or for other purposes that do not require an option\\nto limit under California law.\\n\\n### Appeals Process for Denied Requests\\n\\nIn some circumstances we may deny your request to exercise one of these\\nrights. For example, if we cannot verify that you are the account owner we may\\ndeny your request to access the personal information associated with your\\naccount. As another example, if we are legally required to maintain a copy of\\nyour personal information we may deny your request to delete your personal\\ninformation.\\n\\nIn the event that we deny your request, we will communicate this fact to you\\nin writing. You may appeal our decision by responding in writing to our denial\\nemail and stating that you would like to appeal.\\n\\nIf your appeal is denied, in some US states you may refer the denied appeal to\\nthe state attorney general if you believe the denial is in conflict with your\\nlegal rights.\\n\\n### Contacting Us About These Rights\\n\\nYou can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your\\naccount settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren‚Äôt able to or you‚Äôd\\nlike to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll up to ‚ÄúWhere to\\nDirect Questions or Concerns‚Äù to, well, find out where to direct your\\nquestions or concerns.\\n\\n## Supplemental Canadian Privacy Notice\\n\\nIf you are a Canadian resident, you may have additional rights over the\\npersonal data Tumblr processes about you, including:\\n\\n**Consent:** By submitting personal information to us, or our service\\nproviders and agents, you consent to the collection use, disclosure, and\\ntransfer of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy\\nand as permitted or required by law.

If you withdraw your consent (or if you decide\\nnot to provide certain personal information), you acknowledge that we may not\\nbe able to provide you, or continue to provide you, with certain products,\\nservices, or information that may be of value to you.\\n\\n**Access and Correction:** We will take reasonable steps to ensure the\\npersonal information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date. Upon your\\nwritten request, and subject to certain exceptions provided by law, we will\\ninform you of the existence, use, and disclosure of your personal information\\nand give you access to that information. We may charge a minimal fee for\\nproviding such access to you. If you believe that the personal information\\nthat we hold about you is not accurate or complete, you may [send us a\\ndetailed message](https://www.tumblr.com/support). If you are able to\\nestablish that the information is not accurate or complete, we will take\\nreasonable steps to delete and/or correct the information so that it is\\naccurate, complete, and up-to-date. In order to facilitate a request to\\ncorrect or update information, we may ask you to provide additional\\ninformation to confirm your identity. Any such information will only be used\\nfor the purpose of confirming your identity and will not be retained by us.\\n\\nIf you are a **resident of Quebec** , you also have the right to data\\nportability, which is the right to receive your personal information in a\\nstructured, commonly used and technological format and to have this\\ninformation transferred from us to another service provider.\\n\\nQuebec users also have the right to be informed if we exclusively use\\nautomated processing to render a decision about you.

When personal information is located outside Quebec and/or\\nCanada, it may be subject to laws that have different standards of protection\\nand may allow for foreign law enforcement and governmental access.\\n\\nAs described in the section ‚ÄòWhat Information You Can Access,‚Äô you can\\ndownload a personal data report by submitting a request in the Privacy section\\nof your Settings. You need to be signed in to your Tumblr account to submit\\nthis request, and you will have to log in to your account to access the\\nsummary or the report.\\n\\nTo exercise any of the above rights, submit a support ticket\\n[here](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-\\nus/requests/new?ticket_form_id=12913521777175) or email us at\\nprivacy@tumblr.com.\\n\\n### Advertising on Tumblr\\n\\nTumblr selectively runs advertisements so we can provide you with Tumblr\\ncontent for free. To help select which ads to show you, we may share some of\\nyour information with advertising partners, or allow our advertising partners\\nto ‚Äúcollect‚Äù certain information. The personal information we share includes\\nonline identifiers and internet or other network or device activity (such as\\ncookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address), and geolocation\\ndata (approximate location information from your IP address). To learn more\\nabout how we select the ads you see, check out [Tumblr‚Äôs Ads &\\nYou.](https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360035272334-Tumblr-ads-you)\\n\\nIf you are viewing Tumblr from within Canada, you will be shown our cookie\\nbanner when you first access our site or service, and periodically it will\\nresurface in the future. From this banner you have a variety of controls that\\nallow you to customize the way Tumblr uses your data for our advertising\\nprogram, as well as for some other non-advertising uses like measuring how you\\nuse Tumblr so we can make it better.\\n\\nYou can view and modify your consent choices at any time by clicking ‚ÄúUpdate\\nPrivacy Consent‚Äù from [your privacy\\nsettings](https://www.tumblr.com/settings/privacy). We also respect the GPC\\nbrowser signal and will treat it as a valid means of communicating your desire\\nto withdraw your consent from having your data used to personalize the\\nadvertisements shown to you on Tumblr.\\n\\n**Canada‚Äôs Anti Spam Law (‚ÄúCASL‚Äù)** : We will only send you commercial\\nelectronic messages (‚ÄúCEMs‚Äù) where we have your express or implied consent to\\ndo so.

We also share your information when you use features that involve data\\nsharing, such as when you share your trip or order status with friends or\\nfamily. We may also share your information with Uber affiliates, subsidiaries,\\nservice providers, and business partners, or for legal reasons or in the event\\nof a dispute.\\n\\nSee our [Privacy Notice](https://www.uber.com/us/en/privacy-notice-riders-\\norder-recipients/) for more details.\\n\\n  * ### How long does Uber keep my information?\\n\\nUber retains your data for as long as necessary for the purposes in our\\n[Privacy Notice](https://www.uber.com/us/en/privacy-notice-riders-order-\\nrecipients/), which varies depending on data type, the category of user to\\nwhom the data relates (e.g., riders versus drivers), the purposes for which we\\ncollected the data, and whether the data must be retained after an account\\ndeletion request for the purpose described in our [Privacy\\nNotice](https://www.uber.com/us/en/privacy-notice-riders-order-recipients/).\\n\\nFor example, we retain some data (such as account data) for the life of your\\nUber account if necessary to provide our services.
