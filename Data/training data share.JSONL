comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo

When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that
you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to
that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social

network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network
(if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.

When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email
with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization
code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your
friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your
content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke

#### Location services and recording

**Windows location service**. Microsoft operates a location service that helps
determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device.
Depending on the capabilities of the device, the device’s location can be
determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be
determined precisely. When you have enabled location on a Windows device, or
you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on
non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their
emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise
location, regardless of your location settings. If your device has a SIM card
or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access
to your device’s location.  [Learn more about location in
Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=529987).

the older photos from your Windows device. We never store your photos on our

Some Microsoft browser information saved on your device will be synced across
other devices when you sign in with your Microsoft account so you can access
your data on all your signed-in browsers across your devices. For instance, in
Internet Explorer, this information includes your browsing history and
favorites; and in Microsoft Edge, it includes your favorites, reading lists,
autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), and may
include data for extensions that you have installed. As an example, if you

The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and
videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos
and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where
those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to
your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also
allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your
computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or
synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites
tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The
Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location.
There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available
cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have
synced to your device.

The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and

contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your
contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You
can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such
as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell
you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service
and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync
data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing
contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your
recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events,
including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and
displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.

**Mail and Calendar app**. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all
your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-
party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based
services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable
for easy access, and you can share your recorded audio with friends and
