Project Source: Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar

Project Title: LLM-based interactive consent

Project Description and Scope: Consent remains one of the main ways of
managing privacy on the Web. Consent is often multiple pages of legal document
that is both tedious and difficult for a common people. As a result, many people
do not read the consent but simply press the “I Accept / I Decline” button.
This project aims to address this issue by simplifying the consent by proposing a
LLM based interactive consent reader. This tool will help by providing a simple
summary of the consent understandable for general public. If someone wants to
get more information, the tool will interactively provide more information about
specific aspect(s) of the consent form.

Expected outcomes/deliverables: A tool-based publication

Specific required knowledge, skills, and/or technology: LLM, AI, tool
development

Fields that this project may involve: Artificial Intelligence;Web Development;

## How to quickly use our interactive consent reader?

If you want to deploy the project by yourself, you can follow the README.md inside **FlaskProject** to deploy it locally (or **FlaskProject_server** & **FlaskProject_crawler** to deploy it on AWS environment).

But we also provide a quick setup option, which only requires loading the frontend folder to your Chrome Extension (We currently have a server running on AWS).
