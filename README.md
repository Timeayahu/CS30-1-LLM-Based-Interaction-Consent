Project number: CS30
Project Source: Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar
Project Title: LLM-based interactive consent
Project Description and Scope: Consent remains one of the main ways of
managing privacy on the Web. Consent is often multiple pages of legal document
that is both tedious and difficult for a common people. As a result, many people
do not read the consent but simply press the “I Accept / I Decline” button.
This project aims to address this issue by simplifying the consent by proposing a
LLM based interactive consent reader. This tool will help by providing a simple
summary of the consent understandable for general public. If someone wants to
get more information, the tool will interactively provide more information about
specific aspect(s) of the consent form.
Expected outcomes/deliverables: A tool-based publication
Specific required knowledge, skills, and/or technology: LLM, AI, tool
development
